# 官方介绍

Bolt is a relatively small code base (<3KLOC) for an embedded, serializable,
transactional key/value database so it can be a good starting point for people
interested in how databases work.

The best places to start are the main entry points into Bolt:

- `Open()` - Initializes the reference to the database. It's responsible for
  creating the database if it doesn't exist, obtaining an exclusive lock on the file, reading the meta pages, & memory-mapping the file.

- `DB.Begin()` - Starts a read-only or read-write transaction depending on the
  value of the `writable` argument. This requires briefly obtaining the "meta"
  lock to keep track of open transactions. Only one read-write transaction can
  exist at a time so the "rwlock" is acquired during the life of a read-write
  transaction.

- `Bucket.Put()` - Writes a key/value pair into a bucket. After validating the
  arguments, a cursor is used to traverse the B+tree to the page and position
  where they key & value will be written. Once the position is found, the bucket
  materializes the underlying page and the page's parent pages into memory as
  "nodes". These nodes are where mutations occur during read-write transactions.
  These changes get flushed to disk during commit.

- `Bucket.Get()` - Retrieves a key/value pair from a bucket. This uses a cursor
  to move to the page & position of a key/value pair. During a read-only
  transaction, the key and value data is returned as a direct reference to the
  underlying mmap file so there's no allocation overhead. For read-write
  transactions, this data may reference the mmap file or one of the in-memory
  node values.

- `Cursor` - This object is simply for traversing the B+tree of on-disk pages
  or in-memory nodes. It can seek to a specific key, move to the first or last
  value, or it can move forward or backward. The cursor handles the movement up
  and down the B+tree transparently to the end user.

- `Tx.Commit()` - Converts the in-memory dirty nodes and the list of free pages
  into pages to be written to disk. Writing to disk then occurs in two phases.
  First, the dirty pages are written to disk and an `fsync()` occurs. Second, a
  new meta page with an incremented transaction ID is written and another
  `fsync()` occurs. This two phase write ensures that partially written data
  pages are ignored in the event of a crash since the meta page pointing to them
  is never written. Partially written meta pages are invalidated because they
  are written with a checksum.
