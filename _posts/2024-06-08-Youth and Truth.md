They discovered in Sadhguru someone they could “unplug” with – who did not conform to established sets of tradition or ideology, who was unprejudiced, all-inclusive.

他们在萨古鲁身上发现了他们可以 "不插电 "的人--他不拘泥于既定的传统或意识形态，没有偏见，无所不包。

## Introduction

What we call life is essentially a combination of a certain amount of time and energy. Time is passing for all of us at the same pace. If we sit, it passes. If we stand, it passes. If we do something, it passes. If we laze around, it will pass. Awake or asleep, time is rolling for all of us. Time is not manageable; the only thing we can really manage is our energies.

我们所谓的生命，本质上是一定时间和精力的组合。我们每个人的时间都在以同样的速度流逝。如果我们坐着，时间就过去了。如果我们站着，时间也在流逝。如果我们做某事，时间就会流逝。如果我们发呆，时间也会流逝。无论我们是醒着还是睡着，时间都在流逝。时间是无法控制的，我们唯一能控制的是我们的能量。

Every individual has a certain genius within them. Will they find the necessary atmosphere, attitude, and situation within and around themselves to unfold this? That is the only question. Unfortunately, I think not even one percent of the human population manages to really let their genius blossom in their life because they are too concerned with their livelihood. Very few people remain unconcerned and explore the possibility of what can be done at their peak.

每个人的内心都有某种天才。他们能否在自己的内心和周围找到必要的氛围、态度和环境来展现这种天才？这是唯一的问题。遗憾的是，我认为人类中甚至没有百分之一的人能够真正让自己的天才在生活中绽放，因为他们太关心自己的生计了。只有极少数人能够保持淡定，探索在巅峰时期所能做到的事情。

My endeavor is to raise this percentage to ten percent in this generation. Then we will have a brilliant and phenomenal world, because, after all, a society, nation and the world are products of human genius. Whether we live as a mediocre society or exceptional society is not decided by the masses on the street, but those few brilliant minds which shine in each generation. If we increase the percentage of that brilliance and allow it to unfold in a society, that society will flourish in a different way.

我的努力目标是在这一代人中将这一比例提高到百分之十。这样，我们就会拥有一个灿烂辉煌的世界，因为毕竟，一个社会、一个国家和一个世界都是人类天才的产物。我们是生活在一个平庸的社会，还是生活在一个卓越的社会，不是由大街上的大众决定的，而是由每一代人中闪耀着的少数聪明才智决定的。如果我们提高这些天才的比例，让他们在社会中施展才华，那么这个社会就会以不同的方式蓬勃发展

See, when we say “goals”, we must understand this – if you set a goal for your life from where you are, you can only set a goal according to your present level of understanding and knowledge, isn’t it? You think you’ve reached a point where you know everything in the universe? So if you set a goal, what kind of goal will you set? A very meager goal. And if you grow rapidly, you will be terribly disappointed with your own goal. But this has been taught to you in the recent years that you must be goal-oriented.

看，当我们说 "目标 "时，我们必须明白这一点--如果你从你所处的位置为你的人生设定目标，你只能根据你目前的理解和知识水平设定目标，不是吗？你以为你已经到了对宇宙万物了如指掌的地步了吗？那么，如果你设定了一个目标，你会设定一个什么样的目标呢？一个非常微不足道的目标。如果你迅速成长，你会对自己的目标感到非常失望。但这是近几年教给你们的，你们必须以目标为导向。

one of them, who is running a major multinational company, was asking me, “Sadhguru, we pick the best from the IITs and the IIMs, and we keep paying them more and more, and they keep asking for more and more. But when I look at your organization, you pay nothing to any of them, and it seems to function many times better than our corporation. What is the secret?”

其中一位经营着一家大型跨国公司的首席执行官问我："萨古鲁，我们从印度理工学院和印度管理学院挑选最优秀的人才，我们给他们的薪水越来越高，而他们却要求越来越多。但当我看到你的组织时，你没有付给他们任何报酬，而且它的运作似乎比我们的公司好很多倍。秘诀是什么？"

I said, “See, this is all it is – we are devoted to the process; we are not concerned about the goal.” We are absolutely devoted to the process. Because if you do not do what you’re doing right now well, your goal is just going to be a fancy desire, isn’t it?

我说："看，就是这样--我们致力于过程；我们并不关心目标。我们绝对致力于过程。因为如果你不好好做你现在正在做的事情，你的目标只会是一个花哨的愿望，不是吗？

Right now, because people are heavily goal-oriented, they don’t know what’s happening around them. They are only interested in the finishing line. The finishing line comes as a consequence of a certain efficient process. It does not come because you desire it. Success does not come because you desire it. It will not happen to those who are just desiring it; it will only happen to those who are doing the right things right now. [Applause]

现在，由于人们严重以目标为导向，他们不知道周围发生了什么。他们只对终点线感兴趣。终点线是某个高效过程的结果。它不会因为你的渴望而到来。成功不会因为你的渴望而到来。它不会发生在那些只是渴望它的人身上；它只会发生在那些现在正在做正确事情的人身上。掌声

Riya: Each of my friends emphasize on how confident I should be. So, do you think that overrating confidence has led to undermining the importance of clarity?

Riya：我的每个朋友都强调我应该多么自信。那么，你是否认为过高的自信会导致削弱清晰度的重要性？

Sadhguru: Very much. See, confidence means this: now this hall is reasonably well lit. If I ask you to walk from there to there, do you need confidence?

萨古鲁：非常有信心。你看，信心的意思是：现在这个大厅的光线还不错。如果我让你从那里走到那里，你需要信心吗？

Riya: No.

丽雅没有

Sadhguru: Why? Because you can see things clearly. If we turn off the lights, make it pitch dark, and I ask you to walk from there to there, do you need confidence?

萨古鲁：为什么？因为你能看清事物。如果我们关掉灯，让周围漆黑一片，我让你从那里走到那里，你需要信心吗？

Riya: No.

丽雅没有

Sadhguru: You do. If I ask you to walk in total darkness on the street, don’t you need confidence?

萨古鲁：你需要。如果我让你在漆黑的大街上行走，你难道不需要信心吗？

Riya: Yeah.

丽雅是啊

Sadhguru: Why? No clarity. So, somebody thought confidence is a substitute for clarity. Let’s say, you can’t see clearly. You want to cross one of the main streets in Delhi. How to build confidence? Well, you can say “Jai Shri Ram” and run across the street. Or you can say “Allah-hu-Akbar” or “Hail Mary” and run across the street. You may make it just by sheer chance or because of the compassion of some driver. [Laughter] But if you try this every day, we know where to pick you up. [Applause]

萨古鲁：为什么？不清晰。所以，有人认为自信可以代替清晰。比方说，你看不清楚。你想穿过德里的一条主要街道。如何建立信心？你可以说 "Jai Shri Ram"，然后跑过马路。你也可以说 "Allah-hu-Akbar "或 "万福玛利亚"，然后跑过马路。你可能只是碰巧成功，或者因为某个司机的同情心。[笑声] 但如果你每天都这么做 我们就知道该去哪里接你了

See, it happens many times that if you just run across the street, you make it. That’s the whole problem. There is an element of chance in life through which you can make it. This is something young people must decide, it is very important: Do you want to build your life on chance or on your competence?

你看，很多时候，只要你跑过马路，你就成功了。这就是问题所在。生活中有一种偶然性，你可以通过它来成功。这是年轻人必须决定的事情，非常重要：你是想把人生建立在机遇上，还是建立在自己的能力上？

You do something wacky today, and there may be a payment tomorrow. So, why don’t you think it through – what is the best thing to do? How much of what should I do? How much of body, how much of intelligence, how much of emotion, how much of consciousness. In your life, you must decide which should dominate your life. Accordingly, you conduct it – it’s fine. Somebody doesn’t like it, they need not see it. [Applause]

你今天做了一些古怪的事情，明天可能就会有一笔付款。那么，你为什么不好好想想--怎么做才是最好的？我应该做多少？多少身体、多少智慧、多少情感、多少意识。在你的生活中，你必须决定哪些应该主导你的生活。相应地，你就去做--这很好。有人不喜欢，他们也不必看

There is a certain energy system in the body. If that point of Achilles is in touch with your muladhara, when you sit like this, there is a certain balance, that you don’t take any sides. See, all of us have our own opinions, ideas, ideologies, stuff – our own experiences of life. Your own experiences of life and imprints that you have taken in your mind influence everything that you see. You like this person, you don’t like this person, you love that person, you hate this person – all this is because you are constantly taking positions of your own. But if you really want to know life, the most important thing is you don’t take any position. You’re willing to look at everything absolutely fresh every moment of your life.

人体内有某种能量系统。如果阿喀琉斯之点与你的穆拉达拉（muladhara）接触，当你像这样坐着时，就会产生某种平衡，你不会偏袒任何一方。你看，我们每个人都有自己的观点、想法、意识形态，都有自己的生活经历。你自己的生活经历和脑海中的印记会影响你所看到的一切。你喜欢这个人，你不喜欢这个人，你爱那个人，你恨这个人--这一切都是因为你在不断地坚持自己的立场。但是，如果你真的想了解生活，最重要的是你不采取任何立场。你愿意在生命的每时每刻都以绝对新鲜的眼光看待一切。

This is very difficult for people to understand. People who have been with me every day for thirty, thirty-five years, working with me, doing so many things – I still don’t have a single opinion about them. Only when I need to do some work, I may look at their competence and stuff. But I don’t have a single opinion about anybody who is around me for such a long time. By now you should have formed your opinions, but I don’t, because that is the essence of the spiritual process – that we’re constantly looking at every life as a possibility.

人们很难理解这一点。那些每天和我在一起三五十年，和我一起工作，做了那么多事情的人，我仍然对他们没有任何看法。只有当我需要做一些工作时，我才会看看他们的能力之类的东西。但我对长期在我身边的任何人都没有任何看法。现在你应该已经有了自己的看法，但我没有，因为这就是精神过程的本质--我们不断地把每一个生命都看成是一种可能性。

> 页码 58

There is, of course, a distance between possibility and reality. Some will have the courage and commitment to travel that distance. Some will not. But every life is a possibility. If you want to keep that possibility open, you never ever form an opinion of any sort about anybody. Good, bad, ugly – you don’t form these opinions. You simply look at them right now. How are they right now, this moment – that’s all that matters to me. How you were yesterday is not my business. How you may be tomorrow, let’s see. Tomorrow must be created, not concretized right now, isn’t it? [Applause]

当然，可能性与现实之间还有一段距离。有些人会有勇气和决心走完这段距离。有些人则不会。但每一生命都是一种可能。如果你想保持这种可能性，就永远不要对任何人形成任何看法。好的、坏的、丑的--你不形成这些看法。你只需看看他们现在的样子。此时此刻他们是怎样的，这对我来说才是最重要的。你昨天如何，与我无关。明天你们会怎样，让我们拭目以待。明天必须是创造出来的，而不是现在就具体化的，不是吗？

Those people who are thinking only good things should happen to them, obviously, they are unfit for life. Because, if you do not know how to go through harsh situations well, joyfully, then you will avoid all possibilities, isn’t it? You will avoid all great possibilities of life, simply because you want to avoid a little bit of difficulty. Only when you are geometrically in a certain state of congruence, are you willing to go through any situation no matter what it is. [Applause]

那些认为只有好事才会发生在自己身上的人，显然不适合生活。因为，如果你不知道如何很好地，快乐地度过严酷的环境，那么你就会回避所有的可能性，不是吗？你会回避生活中所有的巨大可能性，仅仅因为你想回避一点点困难。只有当你在几何上处于某种一致的状态时，你才愿意经历任何情况，无论它是什么。[掌声]

The point is, this life is precious. Now when you’re talking about “What shall I do? Shall I do this, shall I do that?” – is it only about how to earn a living? You must get off that. Education is not about earning a living. When an earthworm, grasshopper, every insect, bird and animal can earn a living, what is the big deal about survival with such a big brain?

重点是，生命是宝贵的。当你在讨论 "我该怎么做？我应该做这个，还是做那个？"- 只是为了谋生吗？你必须抛开这个问题。教育不是为了谋生。当蚯蚓、蚂蚱、所有昆虫、鸟类和动物都能谋生时，有这么大的脑袋，生存又有什么大不了的呢？

Survival is not the big thing for the human being. Survival has become a problem because you want to survive like somebody else. That’s the whole problem. If you want to survive, it’s not a problem. My father would ask, “How will you make a living? How will you live? What will you earn?”

对人类来说，生存并不是一件大事。生存已经成为一个问题，因为你想要像其他人一样生存。这就是问题所在。如果你想生存，那就不是问题。我父亲会问："你将如何谋生？你怎么生活？你靠什么挣钱？"

I said, “If nobody wants to feed me, I’ll go into the jungle.” Many times, I went off into the forest and just survived off the forest without any food support from anywhere else.

我说 "如果没人给我食物 我就去丛林里"很多次，我跑到森林里，靠着森林生存，没有任何其他地方的食物支持。

When a street dog is not bothered, happily wagging his tail and going about tuk tuk tuk, what is your problem with such a big brain? You don’t educate for survival. You educate because you want to expand your horizons. You want to make this life into a worthwhile life. That’s what matters.

街上的狗不屑一顾，快乐地摇着尾巴，嘟嘟嘟嘟地走来走去时，你这么大的脑袋有什么问题？教育不是为了生存。你接受教育是因为你想拓展视野。你想让这一生过得有价值。这才是最重要的

See, the problem is just this – people value something only because it’s recognized by somebody. That means they’re blind, isn’t it? If you look at this light, you must know this is light. If you look at this and don’t know what it is, and I say, “See, that is light,” that means you’re blind. Yes or no? Unfortunately, a whole lot of people can see light only when you say it is light; otherwise they can’t see it. Don’t go by such people, whoever they may be. It doesn’t matter who they are. [Applause]

你看，问题就出在这里--人们看重某样东西，只是因为它得到了某人的认可。这意味着他们是盲目的，不是吗？如果你看着这道光，你一定知道这是光。如果你看着它却不知道它是什么，而我说 "看，这就是光"，那就意味着你是瞎子。是还是不是？不幸的是，很多人只有在你说这是光的时候才能看到光，否则他们就看不到光。不要被这种人迷惑，不管他们是谁。他们是谁并不重要。[掌声]

it’s important that you bring clarity to your life, not knowledge, because knowledge is conclusions that you gather. Knowledge is okay when you’re trying to do something physical, material, in the world, but not with life.

重要的是，你要给自己的生活带来清晰，而不是知识，因为知识是你收集的结论。当你试图在这个世界上做一些物理的、物质的事情时，知识是可以的，但对于生命却不是。

Many times what you do thinking “I’m right” may be irrelevant to the situation in which you exist. The most important aspect of your life is you are relevant. Not right – you’re just relevant to the existing situation. “I’m right, I’m right, I’m right!” This is confidence. Nobody cares about you being right. All the idiots who think they are right, nobody wants to listen to them, nobody wants to be around them, isn’t it? People who always think “I’m right, I’m right” – you want to be around them? No. The important thing is you are relevant to the situation in which you exist. If you have to bring relevance into your life, you must extinguish your confidence and bring clarity.

很多时候，你认为 "我是对的 "的所作所为可能与你所处的环境无关。你生命中最重要的方面就是你是相关的。不是正确--你只是与现有的情况相关。"我是对的！我是对的！我是对的！"这就是自信。没人在乎你是否正确。那些自以为是的白痴，没人愿意听他们说话，没人愿意和他们在一起，不是吗？那些总是认为 "我是对的，我是对的 "的人，你想和他们在一起吗？重要的是，你要与你所处的环境相关。如果你必须把相关性带入你的生活，你就必须熄灭你的自信，带来清晰。

people who are carrying information and feeling superior will all be made into nothing in the next fifteen to twenty years’ time. Once artificial intelligence comes all over the place, information will mean nothing because it will be available everywhere. By then you must be competent to do something beyond information. This is why I’m with you. [Applause]

在未来十五年到二十年内，那些掌握着信息、觉得自己高人一等的人都将化为乌有。一旦人工智能遍地开花，信息将毫无意义，因为它将无处不在。到那时，你必须有能力做一些超越信息的事情。这就是我支持你的原因[掌声]

See, if somebody is walking there, if you just look at how they are walking, can you not make out whether they are physically fit or not? You can see the body has been worked upon.

看，如果有人走在那里，如果你只看他走路的样子，你能不知道他的身体是否健康吗？你可以看出他的身体受过锻炼。

Similarly, whether the mind has been worked upon or not, whether your energies have been worked upon or not, are things that are visible. Most people may not see, but if you pay attention, you will see. The most sophisticated machine on this planet is this human mechanism. Isn’t it so?

同样，心灵是否得到了修炼，你的能量是否得到了修炼，这些都是看得见的东西。大多数人可能看不到，但如果你留心观察，你就会看到。这个星球上最精密的机器就是人类的机制。不是吗？

How much life you capture, not how much information you capture, determines the scope and scale of your life. If this has to happen, you have to breach the concretized boundaries of your individuality and push it. When the boundaries are dissolved, then we say you are in Yoga. If one experiences that dissolution, then we refer to that person as a Yogi. Well, how far each individual is going to go is subject to various realities. But should you not at least make an effort, a scientific and focused effort as to how to breach these boundaries of individuality which we ourselves created? Hello?

你捕捉了多少生活，而不是捕捉了多少信息，决定了你生活的范围和规模。如果要做到这一点，你就必须打破你个性的具体界限，并推动它的发展。当界限被打破时，我们就说你进入了瑜伽。如果一个人经历了这种解体，那么我们就称他为瑜伽士。那么，每个人究竟能走多远，这取决于各种现实情况。但是，你是否至少应该做出努力，做出科学而专注的努力，研究如何突破这些由我们自己创造的个性界限？喂？

Oh, freedom! But if you are free, you feel lost. If you go into the mountains and you are totally free – that is, nobody around, nothing around, you are just in the empty space of the mountains – you don’t feel free, you think you are lost. So, handling freedom requires a certain clarity and strength. Most people cannot handle freedom. They are always trying to bind themselves, but only talking, mouthing freedom all the time. If you really set them free, they will suffer immensely. So, this is an evolutionary issue, in the sense, human beings are right now like a caged bird. If you keep a bird caged for a long period of time and then, one day, you take off the door of the cage, the bird will still not fly. From inside it’ll protest that it’s not free, but it’ll not fly. Human condition is just that.

萨古鲁：哦，自由！但如果你自由了，你就会感到迷失。如果你走进大山，你完全自由了--也就是说，周围没有人，周围什么都没有，你只是在大山的空旷空间里--你就不会感到自由，你会认为己迷失了方向。因此，处理自由需要一定的清醒和力量。大多数人都无法驾驭自由。他们总是试图束缚自己，但只是说说而已，嘴里一直念叨着自由。如果你真的让他们自由了，他们会非常痛苦。所以，这是一个进化问题，从这个意义上说，人类现在就像一只笼中鸟。如果你把一只鸟关在笼子里很长时间，然后有一天，你把笼子的门拿掉，这只鸟还是不会飞。从内心深处，它会抗议它不自由，但它不会飞。人类的处境就是如此。

Right now, let’s say you’re really blissed out like me – do you care who is around, who is not around? If they are around, it’s fantastic. They’re gone – fantastic. Because your experience of life is no more determined by what you have and what you don’t have, whether it’s people or things or food or this or that. Once your way of being is not determined by anything outside of you, then there is no such thing as loneliness, but you will enjoy your aloneness. At this young age, it’s a little difficult to understand this – whether you like it or you don’t like it, within this body you are always alone, isn’t it? Whether you do interaction or intercourse or whatever, you are still alone in this body. Yes or no?

现在，假设你像我一样非常幸福--你会在意谁在你身边，谁不在你身边吗？如果他们在，那就太好了。他们走了--太棒了。因为你的生活体验不再由你拥有和不拥有的东西决定，无论是人、物、食物还是这个或那个。一旦你的存在方式不再由任何外在的东西决定，那么就不存在所谓的孤独，但你会享受孤独。在这个年纪，要理解这一点有点困难--不管你喜欢还是不喜欢，在这个身体里，你总是孤独的，不是吗？无论你是互动还是性交或其他什么，你在这个身体里仍然是孤独的。是还是不是？

what we do is just a certain game – life is, because it comes to an end. But the important thing is how you are within yourself. If you are here in such a way that you are only driven by your needs, you will live a very meager life. But if you can sit here without any need but you will do whatever is needed, then you will live a magnificent life. It’s my wish and my blessing every one of you must have a fantastic life. Make it happen for yourself. [Applause]

我们所做的只是一场游戏--人生也是如此，因为它终将结束。但重要的是你如何面对自己。如果你在这里只是被自己的需求所驱使，那么你的生活将非常乏味。但如果你能坐在这里，没有任何需要，但你会做任何需要做的事，那么你将会过上壮丽的生活。我希望并祝福你们每个人都能过上精彩的生活。为自己创造奇迹吧[掌声]

The outside world is never ever going to happen a hundred percent your way. And I’m glad it is so. Because if everything happened your way, where the hell do I go? [Laughter] So, a little bit my way, little bit your way, little bit somebody else’s way. This is the nature of the world, and it’s fine. But what happens within me must happen my way. If what happens within me doesn’t happen my way and just about anybody can take over anytime, then this is the worst form of slavery, isn’t it? Somebody can decide what should happen within you. Isn’t this the most horrible way to live? All the romantic people are not saying anything. 

外面的世界永远不可能完全按照你的方式发展。我很高兴如此。因为如果一切都按你的方式进行 我还能去哪儿？所以，我的方式有一点，你的方式有一点，别人的方式也有一点。这就是世界的本质，这很好。但我内心发生的事必须按我的方式来。如果我内心发生的事情不按我的方式进行，而任何人都可以随时接管，那么这就是最糟糕的奴役形式，不是吗？有人可以决定你的内心应该发生什么。这难道不是最可怕的生活方式吗？

if this one thing you take charge of in your life, that what happens within you is only determined by you, you will ensure that this one [referring to oneself ] is always pleasant. If this one is pleasant, your body and your brain work at their best. In this physical world, whatever success you are seeking in whichever field, essentially it’s about how well you harness this body and this brain, yes? If you know how to harness the prowess of this body and this mind, you are successful in the physical world.

萨古鲁：所以，如果你在生活中掌控了这一件事，你内心发生的事情只由你自己决定，你就能确保这一件事[指你自己]总是令人愉快的。如果这一件事是令人愉快的，你的身体和大脑就会以最佳状态工作。在这个物质世界里，无论你在哪个领域寻求成功，本质上都是你如何驾驭这个身体和这个大脑，对吗？如果你知道如何驾驭这个身体和大脑，你就能在物质世界中取得成功。

You should not send the marks cards home. [Applause] By the time I came to Demonstration School, I was a little evolved. That is, at least there were some numerals on my marks card. Before that, till my seventh standard, I consistently got six zeros in all the tests. [Laughter] Because I never wrote a word – nobody explained to me why the hell I should go to school. I just didn’t understand why I was supposed to go there every day. So I went there, and an empty paper came. If they insisted, I wrote my name. Otherwise, I gave an empty paper without a name. So I got zero, zero, zero, zero… [Laughs]

萨古鲁：你不应该把分数卡寄回家。[掌声] 当我来到示范学校时，我已经有点进步了。也就是说，我的分数卡上至少有了一些数字。在此之前，一直到七年级，我在所有考试中都得了六个零。[笑声] 因为我从来没有写过一个字--没有人向我解释我到底为什么要上学。我只是不明白为什么我每天都要去上学。于是我就去了，拿了一张空试卷。如果他们坚持，我就写上自己的名字。否则，我就给一张没有名字的空试卷。所以我的成绩是零，零，零，零...... [笑]

And every time I gave the marks card to him, my father would blow up and so many things would happen. The drama would continue for three days in the house. [Laughter] Before he used to go on night duty. Otherwise every day in the evening the drama would continue. It’s very difficult to explain this – it’s not like I was thinking he was angry with my marks. I just didn’t understand the whole drama that was going on. I only gave it to him, and he was supposed to sign it, not me. [Laughter]

萨古鲁：每次我把分数卡给他，我父亲就会大发雷霆，发生很多事情。这出闹剧会在家里持续三天。[笑声] 在他值夜班之前。否则，每天傍晚都会继续上演。这很难解释--我并不是觉得他在生我分数的气。我只是不了解当时发生的整个戏剧性事件。我只给了他，而且应该是他签字，而不是我。

If you want to have great carpenters, great electricians, great auto-rickshaw drivers, great teachers and great everything, it’s very important that there is parity between all professions. One profession is seen like it’s godlike and another profession is seen as nothing. So then, naturally, you produce substandard nonsense in the country.

如果你想拥有优秀的木匠、优秀的电工、优秀的人力车司机、优秀的教师和优秀的一切，那么所有职业之间的平等是非常重要的。一种职业被视为神一样的存在，而另一种职业则被视为无足轻重。因此，自然而然地，国家就会产生不合格的垃圾

Children from the ages of three to ten, their eyes are like stars, and they are full of enthusiasm, full of life, jumping around. When you meet the same children when they are twelve to fourteen, they are downcast. You will see this everywhere in Indian villages. I thought, “Why have they become like this?” It’s not that they don’t have food to eat. It’s just that somewhere in their minds they’ve realized that their life cannot be any better than the way it is right now. They know this is a trap. They might not have articulated this in their minds, but the realization has sunk in that this is all there is. A few people manage to remain enthusiastic and full on, but for nearly eighty percent of them, by the time they reach thirteen to fourteen years of age, their eyes have become dim.

三岁到十岁的孩子，他们的眼睛像星星一样，充满热情，充满生机，活蹦乱跳。当你遇到十二岁到十四岁的同样的孩子时，他们会变得低沉。在印度的村庄里，你随处可见这样的孩子。我想，"他们为什么会变成这样？"不是因为他们没有食物吃只是在他们的内心深处 他们已经意识到 他们的生活不可能比现在更好了他们知道这是一个陷阱。他们可能没有在脑海中表达出来，但他们已经意识到，这就是他们的一切。少数人还能保持热情和饱满，但对于近 80% 的人来说，当他们长到十三四岁时，他们的眼睛已经变得黯淡无光

I don’t like this nonsense where at the age of three, people are asking a young boy or a girl, “What do you want to be?” [Laughter] If the child says “doctor”, whoa! The family is thrilled! [Laughter] So without the intent of “What will I become?”, just intense focus on everything that they are doing. Because the essence of everything that we have created as Isha is just this: being devoted to the process. No goal.

我不喜欢这种无稽之谈，在孩子三岁的时候，人们就会问他 "你想做什么？"[笑声] 如果孩子说 "医生"，哇！全家人都会兴奋不已！[笑声] 所以，不要想着 "我会成为什么？"，只要专注于他们正在做的每一件事。因为我们作为伊莎所创造的一切的本质就是：专注于过程。没有目标。

We don’t want to win a race. Just absolutely devoted to what we are doing right now. This is the essence of everything that’s being done. This is the essence of Yoga. This is the essence of the spiritual process. This is the essence of a successful life. If you do not do what you are doing right now, but you are thinking of something else elsewhere, obviously you will only dream of great things. In Yoga, there is a saying: “If you have one eye on the goal, you have only one eye to find your way.” It’s very inefficient. We have two eyes, and everything we have got is only because of what we are doing right now. This is what we are bringing into these children: no intent.

我们不想赢得比赛。只是绝对专注于我们现在正在做的事情。这就是一切工作的本质。这就是瑜伽的精髓。这是精神过程的本质。这是成功人生的精髓。如果你不做你现在正在做的事情，而是想着其他地方的事情，很显然，你只会梦想着伟大的事情。瑜伽中有这样一句话"如果你一只眼睛盯着目标 你就只有一只眼睛能找到方向"这是非常低效的。我们有两只眼睛，而我们所拥有的一切只是因为我们现在正在做的事情。这就是我们带给孩子们的东西：没有意图。

See, what people are generally calling “destiny” is essentially what they end up creating unconsciously. When I say “unconsciously”, as everybody sits here right now, there is physical activity going on within this system.

你看，人们通常所说的 "命运"，本质上是他们在无意识中创造出来的。当我说 "无意识地 "时，就像每个人现在坐在这里一样，这个系统中正在进行着身体活动。有心理过程，有情感活动，当然，生命能量也在活动

He said, “See, you don’t know who you’re dealing with. I know this man. If you throw stones at him, he will build something out of those stones. Don’t throw stones at him.” [Applause]

他说："瞧，你们不知道自己在和谁打交道。我了解这个人。如果你朝他扔石头，他会用石头造出东西来。别朝他扔石头"[掌声]

You cannot decide what comes at you, but you can definitely decide what you make out of it, isn’t it? This is where your dint is.

你无法决定什么会向你袭来，但你一定可以决定你如何利用它，不是吗？这就是你的关键所在。

I made one rule: you can play with her, but nobody is going to teach her anything. So she grew up happy. By the time she was eighteen months old, she was fluently speaking three languages. Because nobody taught her anything, she was listening. She was not chanting “Mary had a little lamb”, no rhymes, no language, no mathematics – simply life.

我给她定了一条规矩：你可以和她玩，但谁也不许教她任何东西。她就这样快乐地长大了。在她十八个月大的时候，她已经能流利地说三种语言了。因为没有人教她任何东西，所以她听得很认真。她没有吟诵 "玛丽有只小羊"，没有儿歌，没有语文，没有数学--只有生活。

See, this is all you have to know: never look down on anybody, never look up to anybody.” And she looked at me questioningly, as if to say “What about you?”. I said, “Not even me.”

你看，这就是你要知道的：永远不要看不起任何人，永远不要仰视任何人"。她疑惑地看着我，好像在说："那你呢？我说："我也不行"

Right now, this is the problem: you are looking up to some people and looking down on some people and trying to be humble with them. There is no need to be humble. Treat everybody as rough as you treat yourself – that is, if you are treating yourself rough. If you are pandering to yourself, try to do the same with others; then you will get tired and treat them rough anyway. [Laughter] So this is simple. I am telling you the same thing I told her. It worked miraculously for her. Never look up to anybody, never look down on anybody. Just see everything the way it is.

现在，问题就出在这里：你仰视某些人，俯视某些人，并试图对他们谦卑。没必要谦虚。对待每个人都要像对待自己一样粗暴--也就是说，如果你对自己粗暴的话。如果你对自己苛刻，就试着对别人也苛刻；然后你就会厌倦，无论如何都要对他们苛刻。[笑声] 所以这很简单。我告诉你的和我告诉她的是一样的。这对她来说奇迹般地奏效了。永远不要仰视任何人，也不要俯视任何人。只要看到一切事物的本来面目

Literally, “vairagya” means beyond color. That means you’ve become transparent. If you are transparent, every dimension of life can pass through you but will leave you untouched. You can handle life to the extent you wish. What you can handle you handle; what you cannot handle you don’t. The moment you think something is good, something is bad, somebody is high, somebody is low, now many things that you can do in your life, you will not do. It’s a brief life. It’s a limited amount of time for the human potential to flower. In this life, if you are choosing what to do and what not to do – no. Everything that you can do must happen. What you cannot do, it doesn’t happen – it’s okay. [Applause]

从字面上看，"vairagya "的意思是超越色彩。这意味着你已经变得透明。如果你是透明的，生命的每一个维度都可以穿过你，却不会触及你。你可以随心所欲地驾驭生活。你能处理的，你就处理；你不能处理的，你就不处理。当你认为某件事是好的，某件事是坏的，某个人是高尚的，某个人是卑微的，现在，你一生中能做的许多事情，你都不会去做。人生短暂。人类潜能绽放的时间有限。在这一生中，如果你要选择做什么和不做什么--不。你能做的一切都必须发生。你不能做的事，就不会发生--没关系。[掌声]

Devotion means you want to dissolve into your object of devotion. Whatever it is, you want to dissolve into it. So in a way, it is a way of making yourself less and less, so that you become nothing, literally. It’s a wonderful way to live. It does not sound good when you say that you want to become less and less. But when you become really nothing, you also become limitless.

虔诚意味着你想溶入你的虔诚对象。不管是什么，你都想融入其中。因此，从某种程度上说，这是一种让自己变得越来越小的方式，这样你就会变得一无所有，真的。这是一种美妙的生活方式。当你说你想变得越来越少时，这听起来并不好。但当你真正变得一无所有时，你也会变得无边无际

we worship this man – not because he is a super-success, not because he can walk upon water or fly in the sky. Simply because no matter what life threw at him – and the worst things were thrown at him – he never became resentful, angry, hateful, or vengeful. He did everything just to the extent it was necessary, and remained a balanced and free man within himself. It is this freedom that we’re bowing down to

我们崇拜这个人--不是因为他是超级成功人士，不是因为他能在水上行走或在天上飞。只是因为，无论生活给了他什么--最糟糕的事情也给了他--他从未变得怨恨、愤怒、仇恨或报复。他所做的一切都只是在必要的范围内，并保持着内心的平衡和自由。我们鞠躬致敬的正是这种自由

We don’t really need money from outside. It is just that we are constantly busy working against each other at so many levels. Our energies are simply spent throwing things at each other all the time. If you don’t understand what I am saying, just turn on one of the English news channels in the evening and watch how much energy is wasted simply saying rubbish against each other, endlessly. [Applause] And slowly, we are losing all sense of civilization in this argument. We think we are debating; no, we are just shouting abuses at each other. A debate means to explore – to use two brains instead of one to explore something. Simply throwing things at each other is not debate. We might as well throw stones at each other, instead of hurling abuses. At least it’ll end soon. [Laughter]

我们并不真的需要来自外部的钱。只是我们一直忙于在许多层面上互相对抗。我们的精力都用在了互相攻击上。如果你不明白我在说什么，只要在晚上打开一个英语新闻频道，看看有多少精力被无休止地浪费在相互谩骂上。[掌声] 慢慢地，我们在这种争论中失去了所有的文明意识。我们以为在辩论，其实只是在互相谩骂。辩论意味着探索--用两个大脑而不是一个大脑去探索某件事情。简单地相互谩骂不是辩论。与其相互谩骂，不如相互扔石头。至少这很快就会结束。[笑声]

The problem is not of technology. The problem is of compulsiveness. It is unfortunate that there are still so many people dying because of malnourishment. We have the highest malnourished population in the world. But more people on this planet die because they don’t know when to stop eating. Yes, compulsiveness. Food is not the problem, isn’t it? Food is good for us. But if you start eating and you don’t know when to stop eating, then it becomes a serious problem. The same goes for the phone – you start using it, but you don’t know when to stop. Fundamentally we are living an unconscious life, a compulsive life. When you live compulsively, then everything is a problem. There’s no one specific thing which is a problem. All the wonderful things that come our way become serious problems in our life simply because we do it compulsively. [Applause]

问题不在于技术。问题在于强迫性。不幸的是，仍有许多人死于营养不良。我国是世界上营养不良人口最多的国家。但地球上更多人的死亡是因为他们不知道什么时候该停止进食。是的，强迫症。食物不是问题所在，不是吗？食物对我们有好处。但如果你开始吃，却不知道什么时候该停，那问题就严重了。手机也是一样，你开始使用它，却不知道何时停止。从根本上说，我们过的是一种无意识的生活，一种强迫性的生活。当你过着强迫性的生活时，一切都会成为问题。没有一件具体的事情是问题。所有美好的事物都会成为我们生活中的严重问题，只因为我们强迫性地去做。[掌声]

Those who are romantic want a full moon day. Those who want to meditate want full moon day. Those who are a little mad don’t want a full moon day. [Laughter] Essentially, it’s hyping things up a little bit. Of course, today there is another kind of textbook science going on that doesn’t observe anything except what happens in the laboratory. These people go on saying that it’s all rubbish. No. If you simply pay sufficient attention to your own body, without looking up, without looking at the calendar, you will know when is full moon day and new moon day by yourself. Because it’s visible in your system; there is a certain behavior.

浪漫的人希望月圆之夜。想冥想的人想要满月日。有点疯狂的人不想要满月日。[笑声]从本质上说，这是在夸大其词。当然，如今还有另一种教科书式的科学，除了实验室里发生的事情，什么都不观察。这些人继续说这都是垃圾。不，如果你对自己的身体有足够的关注，不用抬头，不用看日历，你自己就能知道什么时候是满月日，什么时候是新月日。因为这在你的系统中是可见的，存在着某种行为。

Mortality is one thing that we’ve forgotten, that is why we are thinking of all these funny things. Life is just going away. If this sinks into you, that actually minute by minute you are closer to your grave and it’s going to be over, what will be the most important thing? How profound your experience of life is. And when it comes to activity, how profoundly can you touch life around you. This is all that matters, isn’t it? That when you sit here, in your experience, this is the most profound experience. With intensity and profoundness of your experience, when it comes to activity, what a difference you can make! You may not be thinking like that right now, but think through this. 

死亡是我们已经忘记的一件事，所以我们才会想出这些有趣的事情。生命就这样消逝了。如果你意识到这一点，意识到自己每时每刻都在接近坟墓，生命即将结束，那么什么才是最重要的？你对生命的体验有多深刻。当涉及到活动时，你能多深刻地触动周围的生命。这才是最重要的，不是吗？当你坐在这里，在你的体验中，这就是最深刻的体验。有了强烈而深刻的体验，在活动时，你就能带来多么大的不同！也许你现在还没有这样想，但请仔细想想。

Let’s say you built up a hall, and people look at this and say, “Oh, my god. Terrible!” and nobody wants to come there. Do you want to build such a hall? No, you want people to come and say, “Wow!” You want to write a book nobody reads? No. You want to make a movie that nobody wants to see? No. You want people to see it and walk out with tears in their eyes. Yes or no?

比方说，你建了一个大厅，人们一看就会说："哦，天哪。太可怕了！"没有人愿意去那里。你想建这样一个大厅吗？不，你想让人们来了之后说 "哇！"你想写一本没人看的书吗？你想拍一部没人想看的电影吗？不，你想让人们看完后热泪盈眶。是还是不是？

You must understand this – human activity is meaningful only if in some way we touch another life. How many lives is the question. 

你们必须明白这一点--只有当我们以某种方式触及另一个生命时，人类活动才有意义。多少生命是个问题。

Whether it’s music or dance or cooking or writing a book or building something, it matters because it touches another life, isn’t it? A criminal does not touch other people’s lives like that. You have two ways to live – that is, people are joyful because you are here, or people will be joyful because you are gone. [Laughter] There are two ways to live. Please, what will you choose?

无论是音乐、舞蹈、烹饪，还是写书、建筑，这都很重要，因为它触动了另一个生命，不是吗？罪犯不会这样触动他人的生命。你有两种生活方式，一种是人们因为你的存在而感到快乐，另一种是人们会因为你的离去而感到快乐。[笑声] 有两种生活方式。请问，你会如何选择

I observed, if they’re getting angry and say “shit”, they become a little calm. I thought, “Oh, it’s working for them. I should not disturb this,” because I don’t believe in disturbing anything that’s working for anybody. If it’s working, let’s leave it. [Applause]

我观察到，如果他们生气了，说 "该死"，他们就会变得有点平静。我想，"哦，这对他们有用。我不应该去打扰他们。"因为我不相信去打扰对任何人都有效的事情。如果有用，那就放着吧[掌声]

Those who are not educated are finding a way to live, isn’t it? Those who never went to the college, university, are all finding a way to make a living. But the moment you get educated, should you be more capable or less capable? You should be more capable. So you should give the employment to them and you should become the employer, yes? Tell me, if you look around in Kashi, aren’t there a thousand things on the street that you can take up and make a business out of?

没受过教育的人也在想办法谋生，不是吗？那些没上过大学的人，也都在想办法谋生。但是，当你接受教育的那一刻，你的能力应该更强还是更弱呢？你应该更有能力。所以，你应该让他们就业，你应该成为雇主，对吗？告诉我，如果你在喀什四处看看，大街上不是有成千上万的东西可以让你拿去做买卖吗

in a developing country, every one of us has to see how we can develop this country. If you can’t do it by yourself, ten of you should get together and do it. But right now the problem is, ten of you cannot get together, even two people can’t get together. First change this. If ten of you students get together, you think you can’t start something and run it successfully? You can. But you ten people can’t get together, yet you want to go into a company where there are a million people working together. This is unrealistic.

在一个发展中国家，我们每个人都必须看到如何才能发展这个国家。如果你一个人做不到，那就十个人一起去做。但现在的问题是，你们十个人凑不到一起，甚至两个人也凑不到一起。首先要改变这种状况。如果你们十个学生聚在一起，你认为你们就不能开创一番事业并将其成功运作吗？你们可以。但你们十个人都聚不到一起，却想进一家有一百万人一起工作的公司。这不现实

there are certain people who think that if a thorn gets into their foot they must cut off the leg. If a thorn got into your foot, what should you do? Carefully remove the thorn and walk on, isn’t it? But right now, there are many people who will claim, “Come on, let’s amputate the leg!” A campaign will start. Before we protest and deride somebody else or try to pull somebody else down, we must take a little time and see, “Suppose if I am in that place, if all these people are saying a thousand different things, how would I manage?” You must see this. Right now, are the people who are managing the situation some super human beings that they know how to do everything? They don’t know. They are trying to do their best. If they are not doing their best, we can key them up a little bit. We should. We should remind them that they should do their best. But expecting a miraculous situation…

有些人认为，如果脚上扎了刺，就必须把腿砍掉。如果一根刺扎进了你的脚，你该怎么办？小心地把刺拔掉，然后继续走，不是吗？但现在，有很多人会说，"来吧，我们截肢吧！"一场运动就要开始了。在我们抗议、嘲笑别人或试图拉别人下水之前，我们必须花一点时间想一想："假设我在那个地方，如果所有这些人都说着千奇百怪的话，我该怎么办？你必须看到这一点。现在，管理这个局面的人是不是什么超人，他们知道如何做所有的事情？他们不知道。他们正在尽力而为。如果他们没有尽全力，我们可以给他们加点油。我们应该这样做。我们应该提醒他们应该尽力而为。但期待奇迹出现...

In India, if there are three people, there are five opinions, all right? So, we are such a country, where for everything we have a question. When Shiva comes, we throw questions; Krishna comes, we throw questions; whoever comes, we throw thousands of questions – we are that kind of people. It’s okay, we’re that kind of people. But questioning something is one thing. Always trying to dismantle the existing structure is another thing. If you dismantle the existing structure, are you capable of creating a better structure? This is something you must consider. [Applause] Right now, the existing structure may be utterly lousy, but the question is, right now, are we competent, do we have the resources, do we have the time to create a better structure?

在印度，如果有三个人，就会有五种意见，对吗？所以，我们就是这样一个国家，我们对任何事情都有疑问。湿婆来了，我们提出问题；克里希纳来了，我们提出问题；无论谁来了，我们都会提出成千上万个问题--我们就是这样的人。没关系，我们就是这样的人。但质疑是一回事。总是试图拆除现有结构则是另一回事。如果你拆除了现有的结构，你是否有能力创建一个更好的结构？这是你们必须考虑的问题。[掌声] 现在，现有的结构可能糟透了，但问题是，现在，我们有能力、有资源、有时间去创建一个更好的结构吗？

My wish for all of you young people is that you must have that kind of a desire which cannot be fulfilled in this life. If your desire for well-being includes everybody, if it is all-inclusive, most probably it will not happen before you die, isn’t it? But you took a few steps in that direction, that’s great. What is the point of having a constipated desire that is fulfilled in the next five years and you think you are on top of the world? So, I want you to understand that I am wishing you failure but a blissful failure.

我对所有年轻人的希望是，你们一定要有那种今生无法实现的愿望。如果你对幸福的渴望包括所有人，如果它是包罗万象的，那么很可能在你死之前也不会实现，不是吗？但你已经朝着这个方向迈出了几步，这很好。如果一个便秘的愿望在未来五年就能实现，而你却认为自己站在了世界之巅，那又有什么意义呢？所以，我希望你们明白，我是在祝你们失败，但却是幸福的失败。

Technology has levelled the difference because your big muscle is no more useful – you need some brain. [Applause] There was a time when man’s muscle did everything on this planet, and naturally man was dominant. This dominance also is misunderstood. He dominated in one arena which was filmed and reported; she dominated in a different arena which was private and not reported. [Applause]

科技拉平了差距 因为你的大块头肌肉已经没用了 你需要一些头脑[掌声] 曾几何时，人类的肌肉在这个星球上无所不能，自然而然，人类就占据了主导地位。这种主导地位也被误解了。他在一个被拍摄和报道的领域占据主导地位，而她则在另一个不被报道的领域占据主导地位。[掌声]

Sadhguru: The problem is we are still in such a consciousness that we will exploit anything that’s weaker than us – man, woman, child or animal. Yes or no? Because still we don’t have brain in our head; we have muscle in our head, okay? The muscle should transform into brain cells; then we will see that for you to succeed you don’t have to really exploit anything, actually. In fact, if you get love and cooperation from everybody, you will succeed even better.

萨古鲁：问题在于我们的意识还停留在剥削任何比我们弱小的东西--男人、女人、孩子或动物。是还是不是？因为我们的脑袋里仍然没有大脑；我们的脑袋里只有肌肉，明白吗？肌肉应该转化为脑细胞；然后我们就会发现，要想成功，其实你不需要剥削任何东西。事实上，如果你能得到大家的爱与合作，你就会取得更大的成功。

I will tell you an example. I was doing a program for one of the top international companies. Twenty-five of their top executives were there. It’s a three-day event and I had nine volunteers. I don’t know if you noticed our volunteers here. Without one instruction, they just go about doing everything that needs to be done. If something is not done, I know it could not be done. There is no question of somebody not having done it, because we’ve built such a force. [Applause] So, they watched these nine people moving around. Then they asked, “Sadhguru, where do you get such people?” Because they are always looking for attrition, you know?

我给你们讲一个例子。我当时正在为一家国际顶级公司做一个项目。他们有 25 位高层管理人员参加。这是一个为期三天的活动，我有九名志愿者。我不知道你是否注意到我们这里的志愿者。在没有任何指示的情况下，他们只是去做所有需要做的事情。如果有些事情没有做，我就知道它不可能完成。不存在有人没做的问题，因为我们已经建立了这样一支力量。[掌声] 于是，他们看着这九个人走来走去。然后他们问："萨古鲁，你从哪里找来这样的人？"因为他们总是在寻找减员，你知道吗？

Then I said, “You don’t get them, you got to make them.”

然后我说："你不能得到它们，你必须创造它们"。 

“How do you make them?”

"你是怎么做的？"

I said, “You have to make them fall in love with you.”

我说，"你必须让他们爱上你"

“Oh, how do you do that?”

"哦，你是怎么做到的？"

I said, “First you must fall in love with them.” [Applause]

If everybody falls in love with you, how easy and wonderful it is to work. When people hate you, when they resent you, they will make your life miserable, believe me. When you are resentful about somebody and you have to work for them, won’t you make sure their life is miserable? Yes. This is why people are thinking work is so stressful – because everybody hates them. If they create a really loving and inclusive atmosphere around them where there is no sense of exploitation…

如果每个人都喜欢你，那么你的工作将是多么轻松和美妙。当人们讨厌你、怨恨你时，他们会让你的生活痛苦不堪，相信我。当你对某人心怀怨恨，而你又不得不为他工作时，你难道不会让他的生活变得悲惨吗？没错。这就是人们认为工作压力大的原因--因为每个人都讨厌他们。如果在他们周围营造一种真正充满爱和包容的氛围，没有剥削感.....

Sadhguru: So, exploitation is a silly, unintelligent way of doing things in the world. Inclusiveness is the best way to do work in the world. You know, we are a volunteer organization, over 4600 full-time volunteers and over nine million part-time volunteers. Every day somebody comes up to me and says, “Sadhguru, I can’t work with this person, she is terrible, he is like this, he is like that.”

萨古鲁：所以，剥削是一种愚蠢的、没有智慧的处世之道。包容才是世界上最好的工作方式。你知道，我们是一个志愿者组织，有 4600 多名全职志愿者和 900 多万名兼职志愿者。每天都有人跑来对我说："萨古鲁，我不能和这个人一起工作，她太糟糕了，他是这样的，他是那样的"。

I say, “See, in this world there are only these kinds of people. If you think what you are doing is very significant, you have to work with these kinds of people. But if you think you want to work with ideal people, you must go to heaven – and today.” [Laughter]

我说："瞧，在这个世界上只有这类人。如果你认为你正在做的事情非常重要，你就必须与这类人合作。但如果你认为你想和理想的人一起工作，你就必须去天堂--而且是今天。"[笑声]

If you think what you are doing is very significant, you will work with whatever you have. If you have donkeys, you will work with them, yes? But you have not realized the significance of what you are doing, and now you are busy complaining about everything. This doesn’t mean everything around me is perfect, but everybody is doing their best, that’s all. [Applause]

如果你认为你所做的事情意义重大，你就会利用你所拥有的一切来开展工作。如果你有驴子，你也会用驴子干活，不是吗？但你还没有意识到你所做的事情的意义，现在你正忙着抱怨一切。这并不意味着我周围的一切都是完美的，但每个人都在尽自己最大的努力，仅此而已。[掌声]

Right now, we can use this vessel [referring to the copper pot next to him] to store water, or I can take it and smash it on your head. So, now shall we ban all the copper vessels because somebody’s skull got cracked? No, so we have to culture the society. Educating and evolving the society is not going to happen overnight. If something is going out of control, maybe a little enforcement is needed. But just clamping down on anything and everything that causes a little damage is not the way.

现在，我们可以用这个容器（指他旁边的铜壶）来储水，或者我可以拿它来砸你的头。那么，现在我们是否应该因为某人的头骨被砸碎，就禁止使用所有的铜器呢？不，所以我们必须培养社会文化。教育和发展社会不是一朝一夕的事。如果有些事情失控了，也许需要采取一点强制措施。但是，一味地打击任何会造成一点破坏的东西和事情，并不是办法。

Some damage happens because of somebody’s irresponsible action. Instead of fixing that irresponsibility, we want to destroy the possibility. Many wonderful things have been done on social media, but now somebody gets killed because of somebody’s mischief, so we want to ban that. This is not the way to do things. This is not the way to take the nation forward. Unfortunately, it is true, some people pay the price, but we must bring more responsible usage of that, rather than simply banning this and that. [Applause]

有些损害的发生是由于某人不负责任的行为。我们不是要纠正这种不负责任的行为，而是要摧毁这种可能性。在社交媒体上做了许多美好的事情，但现在有人因为某人的恶作剧而被杀，所以我们想禁止这种行为。这不是做事的方式。这不是推动国家前进的方式。不幸的是，有些人确实付出了代价，但我们必须以更负责任的方式来使用它，而不是简单地禁止这个禁止那个。[掌声]

So, ambition means you got committed to a single idea which came from very limited data in your life, isn’t it? Don’t get committed to a limited idea. Limited ideas are okay in the short term. “Right now, I am here for five years in this university. This is what I want to do in these five years.” This is okay. But life must unfold. You must give it an opportunity to unfold.

所以，野心意味着你执着于一个想法，而这个想法来自你生活中非常有限的数据，不是吗？不要执着于一个有限的想法。有限的想法在短期内是可以的。"现在，我在这所大学待了五年。这就是我这五年想做的事"。这是可以的。但生活必须展开。你必须给它一个展开的机会。

You don’t know how to use your memory, you don’t know how to use your imagination. Your memory makes you suffer, your imagination makes you suffer, and you think you are suffering your life. You are not suffering your life; you are only suffering the two greatest faculties of being human – a vivid sense of memory and a fantastic sense of imagination. If you suffer the greatest faculties that you have, what can we do with you? If you suffer an ailment – understandable; if you suffer a disability – understandable; if you suffer your ability – hopeless case.

你不知道如何使用你的记忆力，你不知道如何使用你的想象力。你的记忆让你痛苦，你的想象力让你痛苦，而你却认为你在痛苦着自己的生命。你不是在受苦，你只是在受苦，受苦的是人类最伟大的两种能力--生动的记忆力和奇妙的想象力。如果你承受着你所拥有的最伟大的能力，我们又能拿你怎么办呢？如果你有疾病--可以理解；如果你有残疾--可以理解；如果你有能力--无可救药。

Don’t worry about the nation, the society, this and that. Build yourself into a grand human being, because if there are no great human beings, there’ll be no great society. If there is no society, there’s no great nation. If there are no great nations, there is no great world. So, you can’t build a great world or a great nation. You can only make yourself into a great human being and, around you, wonderful things will happen. It’s my wish and my blessing the best should happen to you. Thank you very much.

不要担心国家、社会、这个那个。把自己塑造成一个伟大的人，因为如果没有伟大的人，就不会有伟大的社会。没有伟大的社会，就没有伟大的国家。如果没有伟大的国家，也就没有伟大的世界。所以，你无法建立一个伟大的世界或伟大的国家。你只能让自己成为一个伟大的人，在你周围，美好的事情就会发生。我希望并祝福你们都能成为最优秀的人

Family is the smallest unit of a society. But if you get overly identified with it, you will become a crime. All the crime that we commit on this planet – only human beings commit crimes, nobody else does. What you call evil, genocide, prejudice, have all come because of limited identifications that each one of us hold. “This is my family, this is my race, this is my religion, this is my nation” – it is from this that all the terrible things happen on the planet, isn’t it? People who are doing this believe, at that moment, they’re just doing the right thing. This is what identity does to you.

家庭是社会的最小单位。但是，如果你过分认同它，你就会成为罪犯。我们在这个星球上犯下的所有罪行--只有人类会犯罪，其他人都不会。你们所说的邪恶、种族灭绝、偏见，都是因为我们每个人所持有的有限认同感而产生的。"这是我的家庭，这是我的种族，这是我的宗教，这是我的国家"--地球上所有可怕的事情都是由此产生的，不是吗？这样做的人相信，在那一刻，他们只是在做正确的事。这就是身份对你的影响。

In traditional education in India, we believed that – even now we do this to some extent – from zero to twelve years of age, there is not any kind of learning. The child should just play well, eat well, sleep well – because our intent is that the brain should grow to a reasonable size before we load it with something. It’s a sensible thing. But no, today they want speed learning at the age of three. Some people are talking about how to teach the child mathematics when the mother is pregnant! [Laughter] So, till twelve years of age, we don’t want to teach the child anything, except to eat well, to play well, and to sleep. Because these three things will decide how your body and your brain grow.

在印度的传统教育中，我们认为--即使是现在，我们在某种程度上也是这样--从零岁到十二岁，没有任何形式的学习。孩子只需要玩好、吃好、睡好--因为我们的目的是让孩子的大脑发育到一个合理的大小，然后再给它装东西。这是明智之举。但现在不一样了，他们希望孩子在三岁时就能快速学习。有些人在讨论如何在母亲怀孕时教孩子数学！[笑声] 所以，在孩子十二岁之前，我们什么都不想教，只想让他吃好、玩好、睡好。因为这三件事将决定你的身体和大脑如何成长。

Before we start the education process, there is something done to fix the identity of the child. They will start chanting a mantra: Aham brahmasmi. This means “My identity is cosmic”. My identification is not with my family, not with my father and mother, not with my nation, not with my religion, not even global; my identity is with the cosmos.

在我们开始教育过程之前，要做一些事情来固定孩子的身份。他们会开始念诵咒语：Aham brahmasmi。这意味着 "我的身份是宇宙的"。我的身份不属于我的家庭，不属于我的父母，不属于我的国家，不属于我的宗教，甚至不属于全球；我的身份属于宇宙。

Please look at this very carefully: whatever you identify with, your intellect will strive very hard to protect that identity, always. And your intellect is like a knife – it cuts. Whether you physically pull out a knife and stab somebody, or you poke people with your intellect, it could equally hurt, isn’t it so?

请仔细看看：无论你认同什么，你的智力都会竭力保护你的身份，始终如此。而你的智力就像一把刀--它会割伤人。无论是你掏出刀子去捅别人，还是用你的智力去戳别人，都会造成同样的伤害，不是吗

Sadhguru: No, when somebody acts stupid, why will I get angry? [Applause] When somebody is exhibiting how small they are – compassion, not anger, isn’t it? If I am in a bad mood – pity. If I am in a good mood – compassion. [Laughter]

萨古鲁：不，当有人表现得愚蠢时，我为什么要生气呢？[掌声] 当有人表现出自己的渺小时--是同情，而不是愤怒，不是吗？如果我心情不好--怜悯。如果我心情好--同情。[笑声]

So, it’s very important that we understand what is the cause and what is the consequence. Injustice is a consequence of an immature society. Injustice is a consequence of the limited identities people have taken in so many different ways. If you do not take that away and try to bring justice, all you will create is a full-on fight. And when a fight happens, there will be no justice of any kind. All that will happen is pain and destruction for all sorts of people.

因此，我们必须明白什么是原因，什么是后果。不公正是不成熟社会的后果。不公正是人们以各种不同方式获得的有限身份造成的后果。如果你不消除这种局限性并努力伸张正义，那么你所造成的只能是一场全面的斗争。而一旦发生争斗，就不会有任何正义可言。只会给各种人带来痛苦和毁灭。

Alexander: Changing gears slightly, I have a question submitted by “The Prolific Anonymous”. How do you decide between your principles, goals and priorities versus the person you like the most? The goals and principles both come from the same mind or heart.

亚历山大稍微换个话题，我有一个由 "多产的匿名者 "提交的问题。在你的原则、目标和优先事项与你最喜欢的人之间，你如何抉择？目标和原则都来自同一个思想或心灵。

Sadhguru: Well, it depends what you have taken up. If your goal is just to earn a certain amount of money or comfort for somebody who matters to you, you should be willing to drop those silly things. But if your goal is such that it is not about your comfort, it is not about your money, but it’s a larger goal for the well-being of the people, then you don’t have to take a decision. Decisions will happen. They will just happen. You don’t have to decide.

萨古鲁：嗯，这取决于你所追求的是什么。如果你的目标只是为了赚取一定数量的金钱，或是为了让某个对你来说重要的人感到舒适，你应该愿意放弃这些愚蠢的事情。但是，如果你的目标不是你的舒适，不是你的金钱，而是为了人民的福祉，那你就不必做出决定。决定会发生的。它们就会发生。你不必做出决定。

we must understand the investment in problems that people have made. When your problems are my business, I don’t want your problems to go away

You can work most effectively only where you have access and acceptance, isn’t it? People are always telling me, “Sadhguru, you must come and work in Africa.”

只有在你能够接触和接受的地方，你才能最有效地工作，不是吗？人们总是对我说，"萨古鲁，你一定要来非洲工作

I say, “No, I will not work in Africa.” I would like somebody to give me at least five billion dollars before I enter Africa, because without that handholding you can’t make a difference there. You cannot. You will go there and waste your life. Nothing will happen. I work in India not because of my nationality, but because in India if you give me ten dollars, I will make it into a thousand dollars in effect – I have access and acceptance with the people. But if I go to Africa, if you give me a hundred dollars, it will become one dollar, because there is no access and acceptance out there, and the problem there is of a completely different nature.

我说，"不，我不会在非洲工作"。在我进入非洲之前，我希望有人至少给我 50 亿美元，因为没有这笔钱，你就无法在那里有所作为。你不能。你会在那里浪费生命。什么也不会发生。我在印度工作，并不是因为我的国籍，而是因为在印度，如果你给我十美元，我就会把它变成一千美元的产出--我有机会获得人民的认可。但如果我去非洲，如果你给我一百美元，它就会变成一美元，因为在那里没有机会，也不被接受，那里的问题性质完全不同。
