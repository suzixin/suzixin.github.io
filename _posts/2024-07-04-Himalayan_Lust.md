excerpt: 每年，一群来自 Isha 基金会的冥想者都会踏上前往喜马拉雅山的旅程。随行的是灵性导师萨古鲁——他被许多人认为是当代最杰出的圣人之一。这本书是为那些没有随行的人而写的，给他们提供了一次在文字中朝圣的机会，穿行在导师言语中不可预测却引人入胜的境地。书中汇集了多次旅程中的讲座与对话，融合了具体与永恒的元素。这本书不仅仅关于喜马拉雅山，但又因喜马拉雅山而存在。山脉在文本中扮演着重要的角色，时而作为背景，时而作为催化剂，既是心情的烘托，也是比喻的象征。没有它们，书中的某些问题可能永远不会被提出。即使它们有时看似与探讨的主题无关，却始终作为一种强大的潜在存在，最终成为了这本书的坚实基础。

## At The Foothills
> 页码 23

All this seeming chaos is because the mountain range is making an effort to grow and reach its peak, which is not any different from human life. It’s very symbolic. Lots of earthquakes and landslides and disturbances keep happening on a daily basis simply because the mountain is growing. The same is true with human life: if one is striving to grow, earthquakes and landslides keep happening in one’s life.

所有这些看似混乱的现象，都是因为山脉正在努力生长并达到顶峰，这与人类的生活并无不同。这是非常具有象征意义的。每天都会发生大量的地震、山体滑坡和骚乱，这只是因为山脉在生长。人类的生活也是如此：如果一个人努力成长，他的生活中就会不断发生地震和山体滑坡。

Those who are stagnant, who don’t grow, their life seems to be stable and steady, and looks better. But it’s lifeless. For one who is striving to grow, an enormous amount of upheaval happens in his life. But all the upheavals are worth a little bit of growth that could happen within a human being.

那些停滞不前、不思进取的人，他们的生活看似稳定踏实，看起来更好。但却毫无生气。对于努力成长的人来说，他的生活会发生巨大的动荡。但是，所有的动荡都值得一个人的一点点成长。

Now, the first crash happened in the Himalayas some fifty million years ago, and slowly it’s been rising at the rate of five millimeters per year. Though the horizontal movement of the continent is about five centimeters per year, the vertical rise is only about five millimeters per year. This is always so with life. If you put in so much of horizontal activity, just a little bit of vertical movement will happen. (Laughs) This is true if you are seeking material well-being, and especially spiritual well-being. If you put in an enormous amount of horizontal activity, just a little bit of vertical movement will happen. That is so for the Himalayas and it is so for you. So the Himalayas and you are very deeply connected; your struggles and the mountains’ struggles are very much connected. That’s why we let you struggle for these two to three weeks.

大约 5000 万年前，喜马拉雅山发生了第一次崩塌，之后它以每年 5 毫米的速度缓慢上升。虽然大陆的水平运动每年约为五厘米，但垂直上升的速度每年只有五毫米。生命总是如此。如果你在水平方向上做了大量的活动，那么垂直方向上就会发生一点点移动。如果你追求的是物质上的幸福，尤其是精神上的幸福，情况就是如此。如果你投入大量的横向活动，就会发生一点点纵向运动。喜马拉雅山如此，你们也是如此。因此，喜马拉雅山和你们深深地联系在一起；你们的奋斗和大山的奋斗深深地联系在一起。这就是为什么我们让你们在这两三个星期里挣扎的原因。

What we are referring to as a spiritual process is basically a journey from creation to Creator. The greediest people on the planet are the spiritual people. All the others are willing to settle for a piece of creation. These people want the Creator himself.

我们所说的精神过程，基本上就是从创造到造物主的旅程。地球上最贪婪的人是有灵性的人。其他人都愿意满足于创造物的一部分。这些人想要的是造物主本人。

What you call ‘lust’ is a longing for which you have no solution, isn’t it? If it is just a desire, there is a way to avert it. If it is just curiosity, there is a way to satisfy it. Lust cannot be satisfied with anything else except finding the goal. Lust is a longing without solution. You must become one with it, or there is no answer for it. So without lust there is no spirituality. The problem is when you say ‘lust’, people are thinking only of the lust of the body. They are not recognizing the deeper lust that exists in a human being which is far bigger than anything else.

你所谓的 "欲望 "是一种无解的渴望，不是吗？如果它只是一种欲望，那么就有办法避免它。如果只是好奇心，也有办法满足它。除了找到目标，欲望是无法用其他方式满足的。欲望是一种无解的渴望。你必须与它融为一体，否则就没有答案。因此，没有欲望就没有灵性。问题在于，当你说 "欲望 "时，人们想到的只是身体的欲望。他们没有认识到存在于人体内的更深层次的欲望，这种欲望远远大于其他任何东西。

There are two aspects to human nature. There is a simultaneous need in every human being for containment and expansion, for self-preservation and boundlessness. Physical nature is trying to protect itself, while spiritual nature is trying to expand. Only the body needs protection. Beyond that, the impulse to preserve is imprisonment. Not understanding these two dimensions, people have divided these two longings in human beings. So they seem conflicting. But in reality, they aren’t. You have to maintain the integrity of the boundaries of your body, but beyond that there will always remain something within you that dislikes boundaries.

人性有两个方面。每个人都同时需要封闭和扩张，需要自我保护和无边无际。肉体的天性试图保护自己，而精神的天性则试图扩张。只有身体需要保护。除此之外，保护的冲动就是禁锢。由于不了解这两个层面，人们将人类的这两种渴望分割开来。因此，它们看似相互冲突。但实际上，它们并不冲突。你必须保持身体边界的完整性，但除此之外，你的内心总会有一些不喜欢边界的东西。

## The Domain of Shiva (Kedarnath)

When we say ‘a yogi’, we do not mean someone of a certain behavior; we do not mean someone with a certain type of morality or ethics. It is just that he is perfectly in tune with life, so tuned in with life that he can dismantle life and put it back together again. The fundamental life that is you, if you can dismantle that completely and put it back, only then you are a yogi. So this doesn’t come with ethics; this doesn’t come with morality; this doesn’t come with good behavior. (Laughs) Those things will earn you merit in society, but those things will not get you anywhere when it comes to existence.

当我们说 "瑜伽士 "时，并不是指具有某种行为的人，也不是指具有某种道德或伦理的人。这只是说他与生命完全契合，与生命如此契合，以至于他可以将生命拆解，然后再重新组合在一起。你的根本生命就是你自己，如果你能把它完全拆解并重新组合起来，只有这样你才是瑜伽士。所以，这与伦理无关，与道德无关，与良好的行为无关。这些东西会让你在社会上赢得功名，但说到存在，这些东西不会给你带来任何好处。

So today they have taught you morals and values that [preach that] you must appreciate all the paths in the world. All that is socially very good; spiritually, not good. Suppose you want water and you start digging a well here. In this whole valley, unless you think this is the best place, you won’t go all the way and hit the water. You’ll dig ten feet, and if somebody comes and tells you that other place seems to be better, and that you can actually get water at five feet, you will go and dig another hole there. If somebody comes and says, ‘That would be a better place’, you will go and dig another hole there. And in the end, all that you have is holes. Your life will be full of holes, but you will not find anything. Just to avoid this, they created a certain kind of life, which logically doesn’t make sense to lots of people. But the very fact that these people attained and lived gloriously, shows it worked.

因此，今天他们教给你们的道德和价值观[宣扬]你们必须欣赏世界上的所有道路。所有这些在社会上都很好，但在精神上却不好。假设你想要水，你开始在这里挖井。在整个山谷里，除非你认为这里是最好的地方，否则你不会一直挖下去，也不会挖到水。你会挖十英尺深，如果有人来告诉你另一个地方似乎更好，你可以在五英尺深的地方打到水，你就会去那里再挖一个洞。如果有人来告诉你，'那个地方更好'，你就会去那里再挖一个洞。到头来，你拥有的只是洞。你的生活会充满洞，但你什么也找不到。为了避免这种情况，他们创造了某种生活，从逻辑上讲，这种生活对很多人都没有意义。但是，这些人取得了成就，过上了光辉灿烂的生活，这一事实本身就说明它是有效的。

Fundamentally, the very process of yoga is to realize who you really are. Many methods have been evolved; many devices have been created; many support systems have been devised to make this happen. Each master has made it happen to people in many strange ways. Because every master expresses himself in his own way, each one of them faces different types of resistance in society. The social norm is such. Society knows one guru, a hundred years ago, was doing something in a certain way. So now another one comes today and starts doing things in a totally different way. Now, either society has to denounce that man or this man. They cannot see that there are a number of ways to make the same thing happen.

从根本上说，瑜伽的过程就是认识到自己的真实面目。为了实现这一目标，人们发展了许多方法，创造了许多设备，设计了许多支持系统。每一位大师都以许多奇特的方式让人们实现了这一目标。由于每位大师都以自己的方式表达自己，因此他们在社会中面临着不同类型的阻力。社会规范就是这样。社会知道一百年前有一位大师以某种方式在做某事。因此，今天又来了一位，开始以完全不同的方式做事。现在，社会要么谴责那个人，要么谴责这个人。他们看不到，有很多方法可以让同样的事情发生。

So each master employed his own ways, his own methods to do things. Some were subtle; some created dramatic situations. In Isha (Laughs), I don’t want to reveal the method, because once you reveal the method, you have to create a whole new method. (Laughs) Any method works only when you just walk into it and it happens to you. If it is all told to you, it doesn’t work. So here we have our own methods, very subtle. For some we have subtle methods; for some we have dramatic methods; for some we have knocking-on-the-head type of methods. There are various kinds of methods.

因此，每位大师都采用自己的方式和方法来做事。有的很微妙，有的则创造了戏剧性的情境。在伊沙，我不想透露方法，因为一旦你透露了方法，你就必须创造一种全新的方法。任何方法只有当你走进它，它发生在你身上时才会起作用。如果都是别人告诉你的，那是行不通的。所以在这里，我们有自己的方法，非常微妙。对一些人我们使用微妙的方法；对一些人我们使用戏剧性的方法；有些人有敲脑袋式的方法。有各种各样的方法。

you want to buy a new house, or you want to buy a new vehicle, or you want to get your daughter married. That’s not the reason why you say ‘Shiva’. When you say ‘Shiva’, you are seeking dissolution, because Shiva means ‘that which is not’. The blissfulness of the uncreated, the ecstasy of being uncreated, that’s what Shiva means.

你想买一栋新房子，或者你想买一辆新车，或者你想让你的女儿结婚。这不是你说 "湿婆 "的原因。当你说 "湿婆 "时，你是在寻求解脱，因为湿婆的意思是 "非"。`没有创造`的幸福，`没有创造`的狂喜，这就是湿婆的意思。

So one basic thing is how you hold your body. What’s the relationship between you and the body? Or do you have a relationship at all? There are two ways of not having a relationship. One thing is you’re very separate from it. Another is, you have become it. If you have become it, then every little discomfort is a great thing. If you become separate from it, nothing matters. If you hold a distant relationship, certain things matter, but a lot of things that matter to other people don’t matter to you anymore.

所以，最基本的一点就是你如何保持你的身体。你和身体之间是什么关系？或者说，你和身体之间有关系吗？没有关系有两种情况。一种是你与它非常分离。另一种情况是，你已经成为了它。如果你已经成为了它，那么每一点不适都是一件大好事。如果你与它分离，那么一切都不重要。如果你与它保持着疏远的关系，某些事情就会变得重要，但很多对其他人来说重要的事情对你来说就不再重要了。

‘The whole art of being a guru is just this: to constantly puncture people’s egos and still manage to remain their friend.’

作为大师的全部艺术就在于：不断地戳破人们的自尊心，并仍然设法成为他们的朋友。

some say, ‘but my guru is very loving…’ If you want somebody very loving, you must get yourself a dog. (Laughter) Yes? Unconditionally loving, he is. If that’s all you’re looking for – and people are always looking for such things – I am just offering you practical solutions. If you want someone who is truly loving towards you all the time, someone who will wag his tail no matter what you do, get yourself a dog, not a guru.

不，"有些人说，"但我的导师非常有爱心...... "如果你想要一个非常有爱心的人，你就得给自己养条狗（笑声），是吗？他无条件地爱着你。如果这就是你所寻找的一切--人们总是在寻找这样的东西--我只是在为你提供切实可行的解决方案。如果你想要一个真正无时无刻不爱你的人，一个无论你做什么都会摇尾巴的人，那就给自己买一条狗，而不是一个大师。

So, if you look, you will always look for something that’s convenient for you, comfortable for you. What is convenient for you? Whatever reinforces your ego is always comfortable and convenient for you. Anything that threatens it is not convenient for you, isn’t it? So your friends are people who in many ways reinforce your ego; they always make you feel you are great, you are right. If anybody punctures your ego, he becomes your enemy. He need not necessarily do anything bad to you, but if he punctures your ego, he becomes your enemy.

因此，如果你寻找，你总是会寻找对你来说方便、舒适的东西。什么对你来说是方便的？任何能强化你的自我的东西对你来说都是舒适和方便的。任何威胁到你的自我的东西对你来说都是不方便的，不是吗？因此，你的朋友在很多方面都会强化你的自我；他们总是让你觉得自己很棒，自己是对的。如果有人戳穿了你的自我，他就会成为你的敌人。他不一定要对你做什么坏事，但如果他戳穿了你的自我，他就成了你的敌人。

Now the whole art of being a guru is just this: to constantly puncture people’s egos and still manage to remain their friend. (Laughter) Very hard job, very difficult job, isn’t it?

现在，成为上师的整个艺术就是这样：不断地刺穿人们的自我并仍然是他们的朋友。 （笑声）非常艰苦的工作，非常艰难的工作，不是吗？

## Life as Pilgrimage (Uttarkashi, Guptakashi, Tapovan)
> 页码 145

So why we have chosen the Himalayas for a pilgrimage is that you can’t help but feel small. That’s one thing that must happen. You can’t help it. It doesn’t matter how capable you are, you can’t help feeling very small in the Himalayas. If you opened your eyes and looked around, you would feel very, very small. How the ants must feel in your home – that’s how you feel when you are in the Himalayas. You are just a tiny creature. And that’s the purpose of the pilgrimage – to know your place in this existence; to know that you are like a particle of dust in this existence.

因此，我们选择喜马拉雅山朝圣的原因是，你会情不自禁地感到自己的渺小。这是必须发生的一件事。你无法控制自己。无论你有多大的能力，在喜马拉雅山上，你都会不由自主地感到自己非常渺小。如果你睁开眼睛环顾四周，你会觉得自己非常非常渺小。蚂蚁在你家里一定会有这种感觉--这就是你在喜马拉雅山上的感觉。你只是一个渺小的生物。这就是朝圣的目的--了解自己在这个世界上的位置；了解自己就像这个世界上的一粒尘埃。

To know and to experience that you are so small – that is the basic purpose of the pilgrimage. It is also to celebrate that smallness: that we are so tiny, but still if we are willing, we can contain the whole within ourselves. That’s the beauty of being a human being. Who is trying to act big? Is somebody in the bus acting big? (Laughter) Are they? There will always be somebody. When somebody tries to act big, he becomes small, isn’t it? If somebody does not realize how small he is, he will fail to include everything within himself. If he thinks he is big, he becomes small. If he knows that he is small, he becomes unlimited. That’s the beauty of being a human being, and that’s also the struggle that human beings are going through. In their effort to become big, they become small.

了解并体验自己是如此渺小--这就是朝圣之旅的基本目的。朝圣也是为了赞美这种渺小：我们是如此渺小，但只要我们愿意，我们仍然可以将整个世界容纳在自己体内。这就是人类的魅力所在。谁在装大？公交车上有人在装大吗？总会有人的。当一个人想表现得高大时，他就会变得渺小，不是吗？如果一个人没有意识到自己有多渺小，他就无法把自己的一切都包含在内。如果他认为自己很伟大，他就会变得渺小。如果他知道自己很渺小，他就会变得无限。这就是做人的魅力，也是人类正在经历的挣扎。在努力变得伟大的过程中，他们变得渺小。

See, one of the simplest ways to do certain activity, which is beyond the physical, is with sacrifice. It could be animal sacrifice. Human sacrifice has also been in practice for a long time. A life which is in full potency and full vibrancy, if you suddenly break the body, there is a science of making use of the life energy that comes out. This is the basis of all sacrifice. So even human sacrifice has been in practice in various tantric cults in India. Already you are not able to digest it!

你看，最简单的方法之一就是献祭。可以是动物献祭。人类献祭也由来已久。一个充满活力和生机的生命，如果你突然打破了他的身体，就会有一门科学来利用他的生命能量。这是所有祭祀的基础。因此，在印度的各种密宗中，甚至都有人类献祭的习俗。你已经无法消化它了

All mystical knowledge comes from that dimension of existence that people are unable to access with their sense organs. This is a completely different dimension of perception. Metaphorically, it is termed the third eye. What you can see, hear, smell, taste and touch is limited. There are types of information that cannot be perceived by your eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Think of a camera or a periscope; these offer you other ways of seeing. Think of ultrasonic or subsonic sound; your ears cannot hear it, but it exists. Likewise the x-ray is able to see what your eyes cannot see. Similarly, with mystical knowledge; it is about accessing a type of information that cannot be perceived by the sense organs. It is just another dimension of perception. All perception is just a gathering of information on different levels.

所有的神秘知识都来自于人们的感觉器官无法进入的那个存在维度。这是一个完全不同的感知维度。用比喻来说，它被称为第三只眼。你所能看到、听到、闻到、尝到和触摸到的都是有限的。有些信息是眼睛、耳朵、鼻子、舌头和皮肤无法感知的。想想照相机或潜望镜，它们为你提供了其他观看方式。想想超声波或亚音速声音；你的耳朵听不到，但它存在。同样，X 光能看到眼睛看不到的东西。同样，对于神秘知识来说，它是关于获取一种感觉器官无法感知的信息。它只是感知的另一个维度。所有的感知都是在不同层面上收集信息

So for our meditators, for people who have been initiated in the Isha way, Guptakashi would be very vibrant and available because I have laid my eggs there, lots of them. So that space is always more conducive for our people; they will be more receptive to that kind of thing. Uttarkashi would be a very different proposition for you because it belongs to a completely different world, although somebody who touched the linga said it felt just like me. (Laughs) Yes, it is true, but that face of me you have not seen yet.

因此，对于我们的冥想者来说，对于那些以伊莎方式入门的人来说，古普塔卡希将是非常有活力和可用的，因为我在那里生了很多蛋。因此，那个空间总是更有利于我们的人，他们会更容易接受那种东西。对你来说，乌塔卡希会是一个非常不同的地方，因为它属于一个完全不同的世界，尽管有人触摸过林伽，说感觉就像我一样。是的，没错，但我的那张脸你们还没见过。

Food is not a big thing, but when you don’t have it, it can become a big thing. One aspect of Indian spirituality has always been about walking and not eating. So when you become extremely hungry, you tend to become like an animal. When food comes in front of you, you will fight, you will kill, you will do anything for it. But to be in extreme hunger and to maintain absolute dignity, that’s one part of the sadhana.

食物并不是一件大事，但当你没有食物时，它就会变成一件大事。印度精神的一个方面就是走路，不吃东西。因此，当你极度饥饿时，你往往会变得像动物一样。当食物摆在你面前时，你会战斗，你会杀戮，你会为它做任何事。但在极度饥饿的情况下，保持绝对的尊严，这就是萨达纳的一部分。

But when it comes to a chronic ailment, whatever may be the ailment, the root cause of that ailment is always in the energy body. And your energy body functions the way it functions for various reasons. It may be because of the kind of atmosphere you live in; it may be because of the kind of food that you eat; it may be because of the kind of relationships that you hold; it may be because of your emotions; it may be because of your attitudes and thoughts and the opinions that you hold about life; it may be because of certain external energy situations that disturb your internal energy; or the physiological and psychological manifestations which disturb the energy. In some way, your energy body is disturbed, which will naturally manifest both physiologically and psychologically. It is one layer of the body, the energy body. Once it is disturbed, the mental body and the physical body are bound to be disturbed.

但说到慢性病，不管是什么病，病根总是在能量体上。而你的能量体受很多因素影响，原因是多方面的。可能是因为你生活的氛围；可能是因为你吃的食物；可能是因为你的人际关系；可能是因为你的情绪；可能是因为你的态度、想法和对生活的看法；可能是因为某些外部能量状况干扰了你的内部能量；也可能是因为生理和心理表现干扰了能量。在某种程度上，你的能量体受到了干扰，自然会在生理和心理上表现出来。它是身体的一层，即能量体。一旦它受到干扰，精神体和肉体也必然会受到干扰。

Now, people are spending enormous amounts of money and resources to research into the possibilities of liberating the human race from diseases. With the advance of medical science, we have been able to contain so many infections. Almost every infection that can arise today, you have some solution for it. But look at the simple ailments which man is creating for himself, like diabetes, or blood pressure, or migraine headaches, or whatever else that he causes from within. Please see, medical science is not offering any solution for these. It is only offering to manage the diseases, never really talking about freeing you from those diseases.

现在，人们正在花费巨额资金和资源，研究将人类从疾病中解放出来的可能性。随着医学科学的发展，我们已经能够控制许多感染。今天，几乎每一种可能出现的感染，都有一些解决办法。但是，看看人类自己制造的简单疾病，比如糖尿病、血压、偏头痛，或者其他任何由人类自身引起的疾病。请看，医学并没有为这些疾病提供任何解决方案。它只是提供了控制疾病的方法，却从未真正谈论过让你从这些疾病中解脱出来。

Today, there are whole systems of medicine, so many kinds of specialists to manage diseases for people, to manage them within certain limitations. A lot of money and time is being spent on just managing those diseases. It is just like people talking about stress management. People want to ‘manage’ their stress, ‘manage’ their diabetes, ‘manage’ their blood pressure. It’s ridiculous. Simply because they have not understood the fundamentals of how their own life energies function, this kind of foolishness has entered. Yes, if people are willing to do a certain amount of sadhana to balance and activate their pranamaya kosha, or their energy body, they can definitely be free of all chronic ailments. Infections you have to protect yourself against, and be careful.

今天，有一整套医学体系，有那么多种类的专家为人们管理疾病，在一定的限制范围内管理疾病。大量的金钱和时间都花在了控制这些疾病上。这就像人们谈论压力管理一样。人们想要 "管理 "他们的压力，"管理 "他们的糖尿病，"管理 "他们的血压。这太荒谬了。就是因为他们不了解自己生命能量运作的基本原理，所以才会出现这种愚蠢的行为。是的，如果人们愿意做一定量的 "萨达纳"（sadhana）来平衡和激活他们的 "普拉玛雅可萨"(pranamaya kosha)，或者说他们的能量体，他们一定可以摆脱所有的慢性疾病。你必须保护自己，小心感染。

So dharma was created as a lubricant for life, in a sense. See, the nature of human transactions is such that every transaction you make, what is your profit is somebody else’s loss. What is his profit is your loss. This is the nature of every human transaction. When this is the nature of the transaction, every transaction is a possible friction. If there isn’t a certain amount of understanding, love and some kind of lubrication, every transaction is a possible friction, isn’t it? Once you are in a certain level of bitterness with somebody, do you see every little transaction becomes a friction? Only if it is lubricated with a certain amount of love, this passes easily.

因此，从某种意义上说，佛法是作为生命的润滑剂而诞生的。你看，人类交易的本质就是，你所做的每一笔交易，你的利润就是别人的损失。他的利润就是你的损失。这就是人类交易的本质。当这就是交易的本质时，每一笔交易都可能产生摩擦。如果没有一定程度的理解、爱和某种润滑，每一笔交易都可能是摩擦，不是吗？一旦你对某人产生了某种程度的怨恨，你会发现每一次小小的交易都会成为摩擦吗？只有在一定程度的爱的润滑下，摩擦才会轻易消失。

People are always trying to project the conflict on the planet as good versus evil; but it has never been so. It is always one man’s belief versus another man’s belief. Isn’t it so? Why do you believe something first of all? We have always been trying to produce good human beings; that means somewhere you believe the Creator has done a bad job on creation. What we need is not good human beings; we need sensible human beings. Goodness is not what we need; we need sense on this planet right now, isn’t it? We badly need sense. If you are sensible you wouldn’t get into any trouble. If your sense is in full function, you will handle your life well; you will do what’s best for yourself, isn’t it?

人们总是试图将地球上的冲突投射为善恶之争，但事实并非如此。总是一个人的信仰对另一个人的信仰。难道不是这样吗？你为什么首先相信某些东西？我们一直在努力造就优秀的人类；这意味着你认为造物主在某个地方做得不好。我们需要的不是优秀的人，我们需要的是理智的人。我们需要的不是善良；我们现在需要的是理智，不是吗？我们非常需要理智。如果你理智，你就不会遇到任何麻烦。如果你的理智充分发挥了作用，你就会很好地处理自己的生活；你就会做对自己最有利的事情，不是吗？

Action that you perform with your body, or your mind, or your emotion, is called karma. Action that is performed internally is called a kriya. So a worshipful attitude or a worshipful action is a kriya; it is an inner action performed with a devout attitude.

用身体、思想或情感所做的行为被称为 "业"。内在的行为则被称为 "克里亚"。因此，崇拜的态度或崇拜的行动就是一种 "业"；它是以虔诚的态度进行的内在行动。

So occult means that without the blue chip you still manage to talk. It’s just technology on a different level, that’s all. It is just purely technology; physical technology. I hesitate to use the word, ‘subjective’, but it is still subjective because you are not using any external objects. You are just using your body and mind and energy to do these things. Ultimately, no matter what technology, you’re only using your body, mind and energy, isn’t it? But you are picking up some external material and using it. Initially, if you wanted to manufacture a phone or an instrument you had to take a considerable amount of material. Now you are only taking a little material, and trying to reduce that further and further. So a day will come when we don’t need any material; that’ll be occult. Modern science and occult are bound to meet somewhere, if some small changes happen in our understanding of what’s what.

所以神秘的意思是，没有芯片，你也能说话。这只是不同层面的技术，仅此而已。它只是纯粹的技术；物理技术。我不想用 "主观 "这个词，但它仍然是主观的，因为你没有使用任何外部物体。你只是用你的身体、思想和能量来做这些事情。归根结底，无论什么技术，你都只是在使用自己的身体、思想和精力，不是吗？但你是在拾取一些外部材料并加以利用。最初，如果你想制造一部手机或一件乐器，你必须取用大量的材料。而现在，你只需要少量的材料，并试图进一步减少材料的用量。所以，总有一天我们不需要任何材料，那就是神秘学。如果我们对什么是什么的理解发生了一些微小的变化，现代科学和神秘学一定会在某个地方相遇。

occult is becoming more and more irrelevant. As modern technology becomes subtler and subtler, the need for occult will come down.

If you were doing the Char Dham Yatra by foot and there was no cell phone, and if you are gone for two years from your family, then occult would have been extremely important, isn’t it? Just so that you could tell your family, ‘I am okay, I am in Pipalkoti.’ Yes? It would have been tremendously important. But today because we have the cell phone in our pocket, it is not so important to learn how to contact your family without the phone. Today we have an instrument which everybody, even a child, can use. So occult becomes more and more irrelevant as technology progresses. So don’t waste your time in occult temples.

如果你徒步进行夏尔德姆亚特拉（Char Dham Yatra）之旅，而且没有手机，如果你离开家人两年，那么神秘学就会变得极其重要，不是吗？这样你就可以告诉你的家人，'我很好，我在皮帕科蒂'。是吗？这本来是非常重要的。但今天，我们口袋里有了手机，学会如何在没有电话的情况下联系家人就不那么重要了。今天，我们有了一种人人都能使用的工具，即使是孩子。因此，随着科技的进步，神秘学变得越来越无关紧要。所以，不要把时间浪费在玄学寺庙里

When I say male-dominated, I don’t mean man is dominating. That’s not true. (Laughter) I mean, the male mind is dominating. Woman also has become a man today. That’s the most unfortunate thing. Women think they are becoming free by becoming like men. This is the most horrible slavery – that a woman has to become like a man. The logical mind, the masculine mind, is dominating the world. Once the masculine mind dominates the world, anything that doesn’t appeal to reason will be destroyed. This is happening worldwide. Here also it’s happening, but you can’t kill it totally because it’s too deep-rooted. There are still some hardcore people like me – people who have still kept the feminine alive in them. There are many of them and they will keep it alive. But I think this feminine worship will never be mainstream anywhere in the world. It’ll always be clandestine.

我说男性占主导地位，并不是说男人占主导地位。笑声）我的意思是，男性思想占主导地位。如今，女人也变成了男人。这是最不幸的事情。女人以为自己变得像男人一样，就能获得自由。这是最可怕的奴役--女人必须变得像男人一样。逻辑思维、男性思维正在主宰世界。一旦男性思维主宰世界，任何不符合理性的东西都会被摧毁。这种情况正在全世界发生。在这里也是如此，但你不可能完全消灭它，因为它根深蒂固。仍然有一些像我这样的顽固分子--他们仍然保持着女性的活力。这样的人有很多，他们会一直保持下去。但我认为，这种女性崇拜在世界上任何地方都不会成为主流。它永远都是秘密的。

The moment you think you know what is good for you, your ability to receive is crippled. Only if you’re hungry can you eat well. If you’re full of things that you value, you cannot receive much. Only when you have no clue about the immensity of life, you think you are smart. When you see that the way you think and feel is not enough, you become receptive. Once you have an inkling of the immensity of life, once you see how small and stupid you are, you become receptivity itself.

当你认为自己知道什么对你好的时候，你的接受能力就会受到削弱。只有饿了，才能吃得好。如果你满脑子都是自己看重的东西，你就无法接受很多东西。只有当你对无边无际的生活一无所知时，你才会认为自己很聪明。当你发现自己的想法和感觉是不够的，你就会变得善于接受。一旦你对浩瀚的生命有所了解，一旦你看到自己是多么的渺小和愚蠢，你就会变得乐于接受。

When you have some feeling for love, that’s the most pleasant way of existence you know about yourself. It’s not everything. People are always talking about divine love. See, love is a human emotion. It is the most pleasant way to be. You can say it’s the most wonderful way for you to exist. But is it the ultimate way? No. Love means, fundamentally, you are still longing to become one with something or somebody. So you are just longing. It never delivers you there; it is just a vehicle. It is not the destination. Love is not the destination; love is just a vehicle which takes you in a certain direction.

当你对爱有某种感觉时，这就是你所知道的自己最愉悦的存在方式。这不是一切。人们总是在谈论神圣的爱。瞧，爱是人类的一种情感。它是最令人愉悦的存在方式。你可以说这是你最美妙的存在方式。但它是终极方式吗？从根本上说，爱意味着你仍然渴望与某物或某人合二为一。所以你只是在渴望。它永远不会把你带到那里；它只是一个载体。它不是终点。爱不是目的地；爱只是一种载体，它带你走向某个方向。

if there’s no love in you, then you must know something else. You must know the blissfulness of just your existence: not being happy about something; just being blissful, your very existence being blissful. Every cell in your body has become sweet. You don’t love anybody, you don’t like anybody or dislike anybody – you are just pleasant. When you are simply so sweet and pleasant within yourself, your very presence is pleasant. You don’t have to kick up an emotion to be pleasant. Anything that you look at, anything that you touch or don’t touch – everything is experienced as sweetness. Until you are like this, it’s good to be in love, the best way to be.

如果你心中没有爱，那么你就必须了解一些其他的东西。你必须了解自己存在的幸福感：不为某件事情感到高兴，只是感到幸福，你的存在本身就是幸福的。你身体里的每一个细胞都变得甜蜜。你不爱任何人，不喜欢任何人，也不讨厌任何人--你只是令人愉快。当你的内心如此甜蜜愉悦时，你的存在本身就是愉悦的。你不需要煽情就能令人愉悦。你看的任何东西，你触摸或不触摸的任何东西--一切都能体验到甜美。在你成为这样的人之前，恋爱是件好事，是最好的方式。

Now the moment you love somebody, you expect that somebody to respond to you. When that somebody responds, a certain transaction happens between two people. And after some time this transaction leads to certain sense of expectation and bondage. A certain type of behavior is expected; a certain way of living is expected. Otherwise it causes immense pain to one or the other. It keeps happening. The reason why they talked about love for the guru is because he is playing the game just to the extent that you must fall in love with him, but at the same time he will never get entangled with you. You can get entangled with him as much as you want. There’s no danger of him holding you up.

当你爱上一个人的时候，你希望他对你有所回应。当某人回应你时，两个人之间就会发生某种交易。一段时间后，这种交易会导致某种期待和束缚感。人们期待某种行为，期待某种生活方式。否则，就会给一方或另一方带来巨大的痛苦。这种情况一直在发生。他们之所以谈到对大师的爱，是因为他玩的游戏就是让你必须爱上他，但同时他永远不会与你纠缠在一起。你可以随心所欲地与他纠缠。他不会给你带来任何危险

So you will go through a certain phase of deep entanglement; it’s okay. But slowly, if you continue your sadhana you will find, love is no more an emotion; it’s just a certain way that you are. Now it’s not emotion. Your energies just reverberate with him. It is no more emotional. From an emotional state, we can gradually shift it to an energy state. Your connection with him is simply energetic, and that’s very good. That’s a wonderful way to be, because in that state, the ultimate possibility is so close. In that state, a guru has so much more freedom to do what he wants to do with you.

所以，你会经历一个深度纠缠的阶段；这没关系。但慢慢地，如果你继续你的修行，你会发现，爱不再是一种情感，它只是你的一种方式。现在它不是情感了。你的能量只是与他产生共鸣。它不再是情感。从情感状态，我们可以逐渐转变为能量状态。你与他的连接只是能量上的，这非常好。这是一种美妙的方式，因为在这种状态下，终极的可能性是如此接近。在这种状态下，大师有更多的自由去做他想对你做的事。

Sadhguru: Out of all the emotions that you can nurture within you, compassion is the least entangling, and at the same time, the most liberating emotion that you can have. You can live without compassion also. But anyway, you have emotions. It’s better to turn your emotions into compassion rather than anything else, because every other emotion has the capability of getting entangled. Compassion is one dimension of emotion which is liberating, which doesn’t get entangled with anything or anybody.

萨迪格鲁：在你内心可以培养的所有情感中，慈悲是最不缠人的，同时也是最能解放你的情感。你也可以在没有慈悲心的情况下生活。但无论如何，你有情感。最好把你的情感转化为慈悲，而不是其他，因为其他任何情感都有可能纠缠在一起。慈悲是情感的一个层面，它是一种解放，不会与任何事物或任何人纠缠在一起。

## No Take-away (Badrinath)

I just sat there. The serenity, silence and purity penetrated my consciousness. The climb, the altitude, and the desolate beauty of that place left me breathless. I sat in that stillness on a small rock with my eyes open, imbibing every form around me. The surroundings gradually lost their form and only ‘nada’ – sound – existed. The mountain, the lake and the whole surrounding including my body did not exist in their usual form. Everything was just sound. Within me a song arose – ‘Nada brahma vishwa swaroopa’.

我就坐在那里。宁静、沉默和纯洁渗透了我的意识。攀登、海拔和荒凉之美让我喘不过气来。我睁着眼睛，静静地坐在一块小石头上，沉浸在周围的一切。周围渐渐失去了形态，只有 "无"--声音--存在。山、湖和周围的一切，包括我的身体，都不复存在。一切都只是声音。在我的内心深处产生了一首歌--"Nada brahma vishwa swaroopa"

‘If the guru is trying to fit into the disciples’ expectations, he is unfit to be a guru.’

如果大师试图迎合弟子们的期望，他就不适合当大师。

This is happening because every conclusion you make – about anything, for that matter – is always coming from the past accumulation in your mind. Whatever kind of accumulation you have, that’s the way you go on judging. So based on your different traditions and different backgrounds, accordingly your judgments are made. They don’t mean anything.

之所以会出现这种情况，是因为你的每一个结论--关于任何事情的结论--总是来自于你头脑中过去的积累。无论你有什么样的积累，你都会以这种方式进行判断。因此，基于你的不同传统和不同背景，你就会做出相应的判断。它们没有任何意义。

So these people who are always busy making judgments about everything in the world, if they were really peaceful beings we could attach some value to their opinions. They themselves are an absolute mess; so their opinions don’t mean anything. They pass opinions, not because of any wisdom; they are quite helpless about it. Whatever they see, they have to say something about it, because all they have is their opinions. What else do they have? Without their opinions, they will be nothing. With their opinions they are a whole mess of nonsense. So it’s okay. It’s all right for them because they are doing it helplessly. We would like to help them out of it.

因此，这些总是忙于对世界上的一切做出评判的人，如果他们真的是和平的人，我们就可以对他们的意见赋予一定的价值。他们本身就是一团糟，所以他们的意见毫无意义。他们发表意见，并不是因为他们有什么智慧，而是他们对此束手无策。无论他们看到什么，他们都得说点什么，因为他们所拥有的只是他们的观点。他们还有什么呢？没有自己的观点，他们什么也不是。有了自己的观点，他们就是一派胡言。所以没关系。对他们来说没关系，因为他们也是无奈之举。我们希望帮助他们摆脱困境。

You having opinions means you are making sure that you don’t experience things the way they are. The moment you hold an opinion, for example, right now about me, you cannot experience me the way I am. Your opinion will block you. That is true with everything in life. The more opinions you have about life, the less you will ever experience life. You are destroying the possibility of being alive. You are destroying the possibility of knowing life. And once you destroy the possibility of knowing life, you certainly destroy the possibility of going beyond; there’s no question about that.

你有自己的观点，就意味着你在确保自己无法体验到事物的本来面目。比如现在，当你对我持有某种观点时，你就无法体验到我的本来面目。你的观点会阻碍你。生活中的每件事都是如此。你对生活的看法越多，你对生活的体验就越少。你正在摧毁活着的可能性。你正在摧毁认识生命的可能性。而一旦你破坏了认识生命的可能性，你当然也就破坏了超越生命的可能性；这一点毋庸置疑

So the whole process of what you call ‘life’ happens as energy. Only your personality is created with your thoughts, ideas, emotions and opinions. Your personality is an unconscious creation of yours. It is your creation but you are so deeply enslaved to it. Do not go on strengthening this unconscious monster that you have created. I call your personality a monster. You may have a very pleasant personality. Especially if your personality is very pleasant and pleasing and you are deeply attached to it, it’s a real monster because it kills all possibility of you ever knowing anything beyond the limitations of your person. At least if it’s an unpleasant personality, you wouldn’t like to be attached to it; you would like and seek to be something else. But if you have evolved a pleasant personality which is well-accepted in the social situations, it takes a whole lifetime or more for a person to realize the falsehood of what he is doing.

因此，你所谓的 "生命 "的整个过程都是以能量的形式发生的。只有你的个性是由你的思想、想法、情感和观点创造出来的。你的个性是你无意识的创造。它是你的创造物，但你却深受它的奴役。不要继续强化你所创造的这个无意识的怪物。我称你的个性为怪物。你可能有一个非常讨人喜欢的个性。特别是如果你的个性非常讨人喜欢，而且你深深地依恋着它，那它就是一个真正的怪物，因为它扼杀了你超越你的个性局限去了解任何事情的可能性。至少，如果你的个性不讨人喜欢，你就不会喜欢依附于它；你会喜欢并寻求成为另一种人。但是，如果你进化出了一种在社会环境中被广泛接受的讨人喜欢的个性，那么一个人需要花上一辈子甚至更长的时间才能认识到他所做的事情的虚假性。

So about being judged – once you are born in this world, everybody has a right to judge you. (Laughs) It’s okay. You cannot stop them from judging. It is just that if you are a spiritual seeker, you don’t get into this mess of judging everybody around you because with this you are destroying your possibilities. But somebody else judging you, it’s okay. Let them pass their opinions.

关于被评判的问题--一旦你出生在这个世界上，每个人都有权评判你。没关系。你无法阻止他们评判。只是，如果你是一个精神追寻者，就不要陷入评判周围所有人的困境，因为这会毁掉你的可能性。但别人评判你，没关系。让他们发表意见吧。

If you are thinking and feeling strongly about something, you will naturally go there. Isn’t it so? Whatever that is. Now today you want to go to the Ganges, not the valleys. If you are thinking and also feeling strongly about it, if you start thinking, ‘Ganges, Ganges, Ganges’ (Laughter), and if your heart starts beating, ‘Ganges, Ganges, Ganges’, invariably you will end up there, isn’t it? That thought itself doesn’t take you there, but it gives the necessary impetus in you to move in that direction. Still you have to walk to the Ganges. However much you think about it you will not end up in Ganges, isn’t it? So thought and emotion are just instruments to pave the way, but never the journey. This is a simple distinction but unfortunately most people do not get this distinction. They think that thinking about something is already being there.

如果你对某件事情有强烈的想法和感觉，你自然就会去做。不是吗？不管是什么。今天，你想去恒河，而不是山谷。如果你有这样的想法和强烈的感觉，如果你开始想：'恒河，恒河，恒河'（笑声），如果你的心开始跳动：'恒河，恒河，恒河'，你总会到达那里，不是吗？这个念头本身并不会带你去那里，但它会给你必要的动力，让你朝着那个方向前进。你还是得走到恒河边。无论你怎么想，最终都不会到达恒河，不是吗？因此，思想和情感只是铺平道路的工具，但绝不是旅程。这是一个简单的区别，但遗憾的是，大多数人并不明白这个区别。他们认为，思考某件事情就已经在那里了。

Once you have made an attempt to be in a certain space, a certain possibility has become a live factor. It is no more a thought. There is a certain live possibility. A certain investment of energy has been made. Unfortunately, psychological exercises on the planet are just passing off as spiritual processes, where there is no investment of life, where there is no activation of life. It is all about thought and emotion. It will just go on as a psychological process. Psychological process means it is your creation. Yes? Isn’t it your creation? If you get too involved in your own creation, you will miss the Creator’s creation, obviously. That’s what is happening right now. Whether you are thinking about Sadhguru or God or the Devil, it doesn’t matter; if you get into too much of psychological process, it is your creation. If you get too enamored with your own creation, you will miss the Creator’s creation.

一旦你尝试进入某个空间，某种可能性就成了一个活生生的因素。它不再是一种想法。有了某种活生生的可能性。你已经投入了一定的精力。不幸的是，地球上的心理练习只是在冒充精神过程，没有生命的投入，没有生命的激活。它只关乎思想和情感。这只是一个心理过程。心理过程意味着这是你的创造。是吗？这难道不是你的创造吗？如果你过于沉迷于自己的创造，显然就会错过造物主的创造。这就是现在的情况。无论你是在思考萨迪古鲁、上帝还是魔鬼，这都不重要；如果你过于沉迷于心理过程，那就是你的创造。如果你太沉迷于自己的创造，就会错过造物主的创造。

We always think we must set up a role model. If you set up a role model, that’s a desperate effort to be something other than what you are. In this effort, this natural quality of being is completely lost in a human being. He is always desperately trying to be something other than what he is, which takes away his ability to simply be.

我们总以为自己必须树立一个榜样。如果你树立了一个榜样，那就是拼命想成为一个与自己的本来面目不同的人。在这种努力中，人的这种自然品质就完全丧失了。他总是拼命想成为自己以外的东西，这就丧失了他简单存在的能力

> 页码 332

This is all the problem is; you are desperately trying to be something other than who you are, which just destroys the very way you are. Role models you have; too much imitation has gone into you. Imitation involves tremendous calculation, isn’t it? If you want to imitate somebody, you can never imitate anybody totally. You want to improve upon your imitation too, isn’t it? So imitation involves tremendous calculation. Once this calculation comes, you cannot be.

这就是问题所在；你拼命想成为自己以外的人，这只会毁了你自己。你所拥有的榜样；太多的模仿进入了你的内心。模仿包含着巨大的计算，不是吗？如果你想模仿某个人，你永远不可能完全模仿任何人。你也想在模仿的基础上有所提高，不是吗？所以说，模仿是要经过深思熟虑的。一旦有了这种算计，你就不可能。

One simple way of learning to be is you just drop this one calculation, ‘What can I get out of this satsangh?’ You just drop that. You don’t have to get anything, okay? You don’t have to benefit from this. Just waste half a day and go. (Laughter) Really. ‘What should I get out of my meditation?’ Nothing. Just waste fifteen-twenty minutes every day. So do not meditate; just learn to waste some time. Nothing needs to happen. This is not about resting; this is not about becoming healthy; this is not about becoming enlightened; this is not about reaching heaven. All this is just wasting time. When you are not trying to be anything, not trying to get anywhere, you are being.

学会做人的一个简单方法是，你只需放弃这种计算，'我能从这次沙僧中得到什么？'"你只需放弃这一点。你不必得到任何东西，好吗？你不必从中受益。浪费半天时间，然后就走吧！（笑声）真的。我应该从冥想中得到什么？没什么。每天浪费十五到二十分钟而已。所以，不要冥想，只要学会浪费时间。什么都不需要发生。这不是为了休息；这不是为了健康；这不是为了开悟；这不是为了上天堂。所有这些都只是在浪费时间。当你不试图成为任何东西，不试图到达任何地方，你就是在存在

It is just a question of time. You will get there. If from everything in your life, ‘what can I get’, is dropped, it means you will become really boundless and  absolutely compassionate in your life. There is no other way. You just have to drop this one simple calculation, because that is the key to your whole mind and your mental process. That is the key to all the activity that’s happening in the mind. You just pull the plug, and it’s over. Then being is just natural. How else to be? You are only being even now; you are missing it because of too much psychological activity, isn’t it? You can’t try to be; it doesn’t work. You just have to pull this one plug, ‘What can I get?’ At least lower it, if you can’t pull it out totally. Just lower that and you will see, you will be.

这只是时间问题。你会成功的。如果你能从生活中的每一件事中放弃 "我能得到什么"，这就意味着你的人生将变得真正无边无际，绝对慈悲。别无他法。你只需放弃这一个简单的计算，因为这就是你整个思维和心理过程的关键。这就是心灵中所有活动的关键所在。你只要拔掉插头，一切就都结束了。然后，存在就是自然而然的事了。还能怎样？你现在也只是在存在；因为太多的心理活动，你错过了它，不是吗？你不能试图 "存在"，那是行不通的。你只能拔掉这个插头，"我能得到什么？如果你不能完全拔掉它，至少要降低它。只要降低它，你就会看到，你就会成为。

Now you just have to see, what you consider ‘myself’ is not even substance. What you consider ‘myself’ is just a bundle of thoughts, ideas, opinions, belief-systems. So one by one, I want you to see that, ‘My thoughts are stupid; my judgments are stupid; my emotions are stupid; my ideas are stupid; my philosophies are stupid; my belief systems are stupid. Everything that I know as ‘myself ’ is utterly stupid, and I am the greatest idiot in the world.’ The moment you see this, now every cell in your body will be open to know what is what. If you see everything about you is utterly stupid, then suddenly you find every cell in your body is open to receive. That’s all you need to do. That’s what we have been doing to you from day one. Since you came to Isha Yoga, you have been feeling like an idiot, isn’t it? Very gently, very lovingly, they have been making you feel like an utter idiot. Isn’t it so?

现在你只需明白，你所认为的 "我自己 "甚至都不是实质。你所认为的 "我自己 "不过是一堆想法、观念、观点和信仰体系。所以，我希望你们一个接一个地看到，'我的想法是愚蠢的；我的判断是愚蠢的；我的情感是愚蠢的；我的想法是愚蠢的；我的哲学是愚蠢的；我的信仰体系是愚蠢的。我所知道的'我自己'的一切都非常愚蠢，我是世界上最大的傻瓜。看到这一点的那一刻，你身体里的每一个细胞都会敞开心扉，知道什么是什么。如果你发现自己的一切都非常愚蠢，那么突然间，你会发现你身体里的每一个细胞都会敞开心扉，接受一切。这就是你需要做的。这就是我们从第一天起就一直在对你做的。自从你来到伊莎瑜伽，你就一直觉得自己像个傻瓜，不是吗？他们非常温柔、非常有爱地让你觉得自己是个大白痴。不是吗？

## Walking the Spiritual Path
> 页码 368

When you walk the spiritual path, your biggest enemy is the huge sense of doubt that will periodically arise. It’s like a menstrual cycle; it keeps coming at regular periods for people. If you watch it, there is a pattern to this; it keeps coming back at certain times. ‘Am I just wasting my time? Am I missing out on life, doing all this spiritual nonsense?’ These things keep coming back, yes? (Laughs)

当你走在精神的道路上时，你最大的敌人就是会周期性出现的巨大怀疑感。它就像月经周期一样，在人们的固定时间段不断出现。如果你仔细观察，就会发现这是有规律可循的；它会在特定的时间不断出现。我是在浪费时间吗？我是不是错过了生活，做了这些精神上的蠢事？'这些问题不断地出现，是吗？（笑）

In twenty-four hours, how many moments are your mind, body, energy and emotion focused towards your spiritual well-being? How many moments? That’s what you need to look at. You must make an account of it and see how to improve it on a daily basis. In twenty-four hours, how many moments are my body, my mind, my emotion and energy moving in the same direction? If these four are moving in four different directions, obviously you are not going to go anywhere.

在二十四小时里，你的思想、身体、能量和情感有多少时刻是专注于你的精神幸福的？有多少个瞬间？这才是你需要关注的。你必须对此做出记录，并研究如何每天加以改进。在二十四小时内，我的身体、思想、情感和能量有多少时刻是朝着同一个方向运动的？如果这四者朝着四个不同的方向发展，显然你将一事无成。

Your mind is in spirituality, your emotion is strongly with your family, or something else. Your body wants to go to the restaurant, your energy – you know where. When you are like this, spirituality will just remain a dream and an entertainment. Only when all these four dimensions are focused in one direction, movement happens. Transformation happens. You start moving. If you look at yourself, even during those fifteen or thirty minutes of practice, only for a few moments are all these four things are focused in one direction, isn’t it? Those are the fruitful moments. The rest of the moments are just imagination. If you just increase the quantum of those moments in your day-to-day life, then you will see an enormous transformation within you.

你的思想沉浸在精神世界中，你的情感强烈地与家人或其他事物在一起。你的身体想去餐厅，你的能量--你知道在哪里。当你处于这种状态时，灵性将只是一个梦想和一种娱乐。只有当这四个维度都集中在一个方向时，运动才会发生。转变发生了。你开始移动。如果你看看自己，即使在十五分钟或三十分钟的练习中，也只有片刻的时间，这四种东西都集中在一个方向，不是吗？这就是富有成效的时刻。其余的时间都是想象。如果你能在日常生活中增加这些时刻的数量，那么你就会看到自己内心的巨大转变。

We don’t count in years; we count in moments. We want to know in a day’s time for how many moments all of you is focused in one direction. So one ‘take-away’ from the Himalayas has to be that. You just have to keep a count of your spiritual moments in a day. If you increase those, it’s pretty easy to get there. Only twenty-four hours in a day. Not a big number, is it?

我们不以年为单位，而是以时刻为单位。我们想知道在一天的时间里，你们有多少个瞬间是专注于一个方向的。因此，喜马拉雅山的一个 "收获 "就是这个。你只需计算一天中的精神时刻。如果你能增加这些时间，就很容易达到目标。一天只有二十四小时。不是个大数字，不是吗？

So there is no safety in stagnation. A seed is meaningful only for a certain span of time, but to remain a seed is stagnation. Seed is life, potential life, and that’s very important. But if you try to keep anything in a state of stagnation, for sure you will lose it. The only safety is to make it grow. The only safety is to make it sprout and prosper. Whether it’s your body or your mind or your life, the only safety is in allowing it to grow, not in trying to preserve it. Try this with your body and see. Many of you have tried, haven’t you? Because you want to live for a long time, from tomorrow onwards, eat all the best food and save the body; don’t use it. If you want we can provide you a coffin, because anyway you will need it very soon. There is no safety in trying to save the body; that’s not the way life is made. The only way to save it is to use it. So the only way a seed can be safe is for it to sprout and become a plant and a tree; that is the only way there is safety for the seed. In stagnation, there is no safety.

因此，停滞不前是不安全的。一粒种子只有在一定的时间跨度内才有意义，但停留在一粒种子上就是停滞不前。种子是生命，是潜在的生命，这一点非常重要。但如果你试图让任何事物处于停滞状态，你肯定会失去它。唯一安全的办法就是让它生长。唯一的安全就是让它发芽、繁荣。无论是你的身体、思想还是生命，唯一的安全就是让它成长，而不是试图保护它。用你的身体试试看。你们很多人都试过，不是吗？因为你们想长寿，从明天开始，吃所有最好的食物，保存身体；不要使用它。如果你们需要，我们可以为你们提供棺材，因为无论如何，你们很快就会需要它。试图保存身体是不安全的，生命不是这样创造的。拯救生命的唯一办法就是利用它。因此，种子安全的唯一途径就是发芽，成为一棵草、一棵树；只有这样，种子才是安全的。停滞不前，就没有安全可言

Right now, in a situation like this – a few people just sitting in a relaxed atmosphere – if you choose, you can just involve yourself without any inhibition. That’s because you’re not identified. There’s nothing to be lost, nothing to be gained. You can just throw yourself into it. But when you are identified, each time your involvement questions and threatens who you are and what you are. So every situation – if it is not going the way you think it should be going – your very identity is threatened; it becomes a very insecure and fearful situation for you. Once you go through this experience, your whole sense of involvement will come down. You become subdued, less involved with life. You can truly involve yourself with life only when you are not identified with it. That goes both for thought and the situations in which we live.

现在，在这样的情况下--几个人坐在一起，气氛轻松--只要你愿意，你就可以毫无顾忌地参与进来。这是因为你的身份没有被确认。你不会失去什么，也不会得到什么。你可以全身心地投入其中。但是，当你的身份被确认时，你的每一次参与都会质疑和威胁你是谁，你是什么。因此，每一种情况--如果它没有按照你认为的方式发展--你的身份都会受到威胁；对你来说，它变成了一种非常不安全和恐惧的情况。一旦你经历了这种体验，你的整个参与感就会下降。你会变得低调，不再那么投入生活。只有当你不认同生活时，你才能真正融入生活。这既适用于思想，也适用于我们生活的环境。

Sadhguru: Now, if something did happen to one of your loved ones, if you are not identified with it, you will do everything to the best of your ability. Your affection is not gone just because you are not identified. But if you are identified with it, you won’t sleep; you won’t eat; you won’t do the things that you could have done properly. So you tell me, which is the best way to be? To retain all your faculties and capabilities, or to lose them? Which is right?

萨迪古鲁：现在，如果你所爱的人发生了什么事，如果你不认同他，你会尽你所能做好每一件事。你的感情不会因为你不认同它而消失。但如果你认定了它，你就会睡不着觉、吃不下饭、做不好本可以做好的事情。那么你告诉我，哪种方式最好？是保留你所有的能力，还是失去它们？哪种方式是正确的？

If you just understand the limitations of the mind and accept it for its limitations; if you value the opinions of your mind within those limited spaces that it understands; if the rest of the time, you see that it has no perception of the other aspects of life; and if you just keep yourself open – then what needs to happen, will happen. But if you go on aspiring to somehow kill the mind or to avoid the mind, it will be a futile effort. And in fact, there is really no effort. It is just that you are only trying to enhance the mind.

如果你能理解心灵的局限性并接受它的局限性；如果你能重视心灵在它所理解的有限空间内的观点；如果在其他时间里，你能看到心灵对生活的其他方面毫无感知；如果你能保持开放的心态--那么该发生的事就会发生。但是，如果你继续渴望以某种方式扼杀心灵或避免心灵，那将是徒劳无功的。事实上，你根本没有努力。你只是在努力增强心智。

Similarly, your mind may be good at certain things; use it for that. If you try to consult it for everything, then it will be no good. So just recognize the limitations of your mind. What’s beyond it, don’t ask it. What’s within its realm, use it.

同样，你的头脑可能擅长某些事情，那就利用它吧。如果你什么事都想请教它，那么它将一无是处。所以，只需认识到你的大脑的局限性。超越它的，就不要问它。在它范围内的，就用它。

When we utter the word ‘spirituality,’ what we are saying is, ‘I want to become all-inclusive. Or all-exclusive. I want to include everything as a part of myself, or I want to just exclude everything, including myself.’ These are the two ways – either include everything or exclude everything. Either become infinite, or become zero. These are the only two ways. There are only two doors to this. If you climb – one, two, three, four, five – there are no doors; it’s a trap. There are only two doors. One is the infinite, the other is zero.

当我们说出'灵性'这个词时，我们的意思是'我想变得包罗万象。或者包罗万象。我想把一切都纳入自己的一部分，或者我想把一切都排除在外，包括我自己。这就是两种方式--要么包含一切，要么排除一切。要么成为无限，要么成为零。只有这两条路。只有两扇门。如果你往上爬--一、二、三、四、五--就没有门了；这是个陷阱。只有两扇门。一扇是无限，另一扇是零。

Or your enjoyment is that nobody else has what you have. That is definitely a sickness, isn’t it? Your only joy in the world is that you have something that nobody else has – isn’t it a sickness? Unfortunately ninety-five per cent of the population is psychologically ill because that’s the only pleasure they have. If they wear these clothes, nobody else should be wearing them. If everybody is wearing this, they cannot enjoy it. If they build a house, nobody else should have that kind of house – only then they can enjoy it. This is not joy; this is just illness. You need treatment. Unfortunately, ninety-five per cent of the world needs treatment. It’s sad, but that’s how it is. Let’s enjoy the madhouse. What else to do? That’s all the choice we are given. We have to live with crazy people – mentally ill people.

或者说，你的乐趣在于别人没有你有的东西。这绝对是一种病态，不是吗？你在世界上唯一的乐趣就是你拥有别人没有的东西，这难道不是一种病吗？不幸的是，95% 的人都有心理疾病，因为这是他们唯一的乐趣。如果他们穿这些衣服，其他人就不应该穿。如果每个人都穿这个，他们就无法享受它。如果他们盖了房子，别人也不应该有这样的房子，只有这样他们才能享受到快乐。这不是快乐，这只是疾病。你需要治疗。不幸的是，世界上 95% 的人都需要治疗。这很可悲，但事实就是如此。让我们享受疯人院吧。还能做什么？这就是我们的选择。我们不得不与疯子--精神病人--生活在一起。

You can’t teach madness to people. They have to be infected. Infection is always a transmission, isn’t it? (Laughs) It’s not easy to get it. (Laughs) When you were in school, you would have tried. When you don’t want to go to school, you want to catch diphtheria for a day. But it doesn’t come, you know. Have you tried? You want at least to catch the ‘flu. The damn thing doesn’t come. (Laughs) It’s not easy.

你不能把疯狂教给别人。他们必须被感染。感染总是一种传播，不是吗？要感染可不容易。当你在学校的时候，你会尝试的。当你不想上学的时候，你就想染上白喉一天。但它不会来，你知道的。你试过了吗？你至少想得流感。可那鬼东西就是不来。这可不容易。

You have to be ripe and the right kind of things have to come your way; only then it happens. Even a disease, when you want it, you won’t get it. (Laughs) So this is also just like that. Because you want it, you don’t get it. You have to make yourself vulnerable, receptive. The spores are all over the place. If you are vulnerable, you will get it. It will catch you. Those who are vulnerable will anyway catch it. It doesn’t matter whether they came to the program or not. The program is just about making you vulnerable. The teaching is just about making you vulnerable. But it is not the real thing. That is why we can train teachers to do it, because their work is just to make somebody vulnerable. They themselves are not doing anything.

你必须成熟，必须有合适的东西出现在你面前；只有这样，它才会发生。即使是疾病，当你想要它时，你也得不到。所以这也是一样的。因为你想要，所以你得不到。你必须让自己变得脆弱、容易接受。孢子到处都是。如果你是脆弱的，你就会得到它。它会传染给你。那些脆弱的人无论如何都会感染。至于他们是否参加了这个项目，这并不重要。课程只是为了让你变得脆弱。教学只是让你变得脆弱。但这不是真正的东西。这就是为什么我们可以培训教师这样做，因为他们的工作只是让别人变得脆弱。他们自己什么也没做。

If it doesn’t ring, who will take the call? Your phone is on silent; I am calling you and calling you and calling you; but they’re all ‘missed calls’. (Laughter) It takes somebody to make some noise; otherwise life will remain a missed call. So teachers are very important. Without the noise of teaching, there will be no transmission. Actually, it would be wrong to say ‘no transmission’; there will be some transmission, but it will become very minimal. Only with the teaching the vulnerability has increased, and because of that, more spores are being made use of.

如果电话不响，谁来接听呢？你的电话是静音的；我给你打了又打，打了又打；但都是 "未接来电"。需要有人发出声音，否则生活就会一直是未接来电。因此，教师非常重要。没有教学的声音，就不会有传播。事实上，说 "没有传播 "是不对的；会有一些传播，但会变得非常小。只有在教学过程中，脆弱性才会增加，正因为如此，才会有更多的孢子被利用。
